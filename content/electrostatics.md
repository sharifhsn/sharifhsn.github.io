What is electricity, and how does it work?

## Electrons

Fundamentally, the negative charge comes from the **electron**, a subatomic particle. The positive charge comes from **protons**, also in the atom. The unit of the charge is the **Coulomb** (\\(C\\)). An electron has a charge of \\(-1.60×10^{-16} C\\), and a proton has the same charge but positive. However, the proton is much heavier than an electron, being about 1836 times as massive. This means that electrons are easy to displace, which is why their movement is the fundamental concept behind electricity.

The way that electric charge is generated is by rubbing two materials together in a way that transfers electrons between the two. For example, if you rub your clothes against a shag carpet, it will transfer electrons to your clothes.

*However, charge is neither created nor destroyed, due to the law of conservation of electric charge!*

As you might already know from playing around with magnets, like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other. This attraction is known as the **electrostatic force**.

## Conductors/Insulators

Electric charge is not limited to its power to attract and repel. It can also move through objects; this is how electricity travels from power plants to your house, through wires. Not all materials are created equal in their ability to **conduct** electricity through them. Those that conduct poorly are called electrical **insulators** and those that can well are called electrical **conductors**. This material property is typically related to how easily valence electrons can move around in the molecules of the material.

## Charging by Contact/Induction

I said before that electrical charge can be generated by rubbing, for example against a shag carpet. This is known as **charging by contact**. However, this is not the only way to charge an object. As we know, electrons can be attracted and repelled. If a negatively charged object is brought close to a neutrally charged object, the electrons in the neutrally charged object will be repelled to the other side, changing the distribution of charge in the object. This is known as **charging by induction** because the electrons are induced by the charge to move.

This effect will disappear when the inducing object leaves, unless we introduce **grounding**. A grounding wire is a way to disappear free electrons from a charged object. Typically, an object is wired to a large diffuse object such as the earth, so free electrons will leave the small object forever. In the example I used above, if there is a grounding wire attached to the other side where the electrons were repelled to, then those electrons would "disappear". After the inducing object leaves, the formerly neutral object would become positively charged.

This can even occur in materials like plastic which are insulating. Although the free electrons cannot move as in materials like metals, positive charges can still be induced towards the surface, allowing for a surface positive charge that negatively charged objects to stick to.

## Coulomb's Law

**The magnitude \\(F\\) of the electrostatic force exerted by one point charge \\(q_1\\) on another point charge \\(q_2\\) is directly proportional to the magnitudes \\(|q_1|\\) and \\(|q_2|\\) of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance \\(r\\) between them:**

$$ F = k\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2} $$

**where \\(k\\) is a proportionality constant: \\(k = 8.99 × 10^9 N \cdot m^2/C^2\\) in SI units.**

So what does this law mean?
