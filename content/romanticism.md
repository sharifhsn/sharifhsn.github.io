The modern image of a poet is of a dreamy, emotional, sensitive, often mentally ill artist. Why is that?

Following the Enlightenment period, there was a general desire among the intelligentsia to return to a more emotional, sensitive perspective instead of the rational, objective perspective of the Enlightenment. This movement was called **Romanticism**.

## I Sing the Body Electric

Walt Whitman "helps" an auctioneer sell a slave by exholting the slave's qualities to show how valuable a life is.

He points out how the blood that runs in the slave is the same as everyone else's, it has the same passion. This is a criticism of the idea of "blood purity" in his day, where one drop of Negro blood would taint a white bloodline. He sees the value of blood in the emotions it engenders, not purity.

He also reflects on the ancestry and descendancy of slaves. In general, this passage is a logical argument against slavery.

It's a far more political poem than one would expect, however. In fact, it's a total refutation to the idea of a dreamy poet. In Whitman's day, this poem would be downright incendiary.
