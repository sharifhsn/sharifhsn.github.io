are the method by which all electricity travels throughout the world and power every single device in existence. It is therefore crucial to understand them while understanding electricity.\nElectromotive Force (emf) and Current\nThe emf is similar to voltage, but not quite the same. It is the maximum voltage of a battery, signified by \\(Ε\\) (capital epsilon). It represents the maximum amount of joules of energy that can transfer from a battery based on the charge.\nCurrent is formed when an electric field parallel to a wire moves free electrons from the positive terminal of a battery to the negative terminal. You can think of it mentally like the flow of charge over time, like water going through a hose, and in fact the equation is \\(I = \\frac{Δq}{Δt}\\). For a non-constant flow, this is the average current. Current uses the unit \\(A\\) for ampere.\nA direct current (dc) has electrons that go through the circuit in the same direction at all times, which is negative to positive. An alternating current (ac) alternates direction constantly from moment to moment.\n\nVery important note: electron flow and conventional current \\(I\\) are not the same thing. Conventional current actually goes opposite to electron flow for historical reasons. When we draw current over circuits, we use conventional current notation, so current flows from positive to negative. This is because it was once thought that circuits worked by the passing of positive charges, not negative charges.\n\nOhm's Law\nThe ratio \\(V/I\\) is a constant, where \\(V\\) is the voltage applied across a piece of material (such as a wire) and \\(I\\) is the current through the material:\n$$\\frac{V}{I} = R = constant | V = IR$$\n\\(R\\) is the resistance of the piece of material in ohms (Ω).\nAgain using our hose analogy, resistance is like how narrow the hose opening is which lets our water through. Resistance is typically discussed in the context of resistors, which are electrical devices that apply resistance to a circuit.\nResistance and Resistivity\nThe resistance of a piece of material is dependent on certain qualities. If you think in your head of a small plastic tic-tac as our resistor, this is the formula:\n$$R = ρ\\frac{L}{A}$$\nwhere \\(L\\) is length, \\(A\\) is cross-sectional area, and \\(ρ\\) is a constant called resistivity that is constant to a material. Conductors have very low resistivities, and insulators have very high resistivities.\nResistivity also typically depends on temperature, though in more complicated ways than can be expressed in the above formula. The most common way to express it as:\n$$ρ = ρ_0[1 + α(T - T_0)]$$\nYou can also use resistance instead of resistivity here. The important constant here is \\(α\\), which is the temperature coefficient of resistivity, which can be positive or negative depending on how the specific material relates resistivity to temperature.\n\nSome materials, known as superconductors, have resistivity of zero at certain temperatures. This means you can circulate a current indefinitely within that circuit without needing a supply of emf from a battery. They can be used in MRI, maglevs, and computer chips.\n\nPOWER\nPower is an important concept when we want to give energy to electrical appliances. The easiest way to think about it on a high level is the change in energy per unit time. Another way to think about it is the flow of voltage transferred.\n$$P = \\frac{Change\\ in\\ energy}{Time\\ interval} = \\frac{(Δq)V}{Δt} = \\frac{Δq}{Δt}V = IV$$\nThe units of power are in watts \\(W\\), which you might remember from lightbulbs. Current multiplied by voltage makes sense; it's the flow multiplied by the quantity, which tells you change in quantity over time. You can also write it as:\n$$P = IV = I^2R = \\frac{V^2}{R}$$\nwhich is often useful when we don't have one of those elements.\nAlternating Current\nMost batteries in the world use ac instead of dc. Therefore, we must note the differences between it and dc. The voltage is not always the same, and fluctuates constantly according to this equation:\n$$V = V_0 \\sin{2πft}$$\nwhere \\(V_0\\) is the maximum voltage and \\(f\\) is the frequence of isolation. This value is in radians when the sine function is applied.\nCurrent oscillates at the same rate, and so does power. We can simply substitute the above equation for \\(V\\) to evaluate those.\nWe often want to understand average current and average voltage in relation to power, which are calculated by dividing the maximum of each by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). We can use these two values to get average power through the analogous power equations.\nSeries Wiring\nAll the circuits we've discussed have one device with a straight wire. Often we want to have multiple devices on the same circuit.\nWhen we have multiple resistors in series, their resistances added up to get the total resistance of a circuit. A very useful method to solve these kinds of problems is to \"combine\" resistors by adding up their resistances. This becomes helpful when we start working with parallel wiring.\nAnother way we can think about voltage in this context is that we have voltage that goes through each resistor which is added up to get the final voltage. This will be relevant later when we talk about voltage drops.\nParallel Wiring\nParallel wiring is wiring where the voltage across each device is the same. Now, this might not necessarily make sense; wouldn't the voltage be divided still? The element that is divided in parallel is actually the current, whereas in series it is the current that is preserved and the voltage that is divided. This is useful when we want multiple appliances connected to the same power source that do not interfere with each other with respect to voltage.\nParallel resistors, paradoxically, act as if they have less resistance. Instead of adding up the resistances straightforwardly, parallel resistances add up as so:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_p} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + ...$$\nA more convenient way to calculate this is\n$$R_p = \\frac{R_1 \\cdot R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$$\nfor only two circuits, though it gets more complex for more.\nWhen we have multiple parts in series and parallel, the way to solve comes by combining different series and parallel parts together. Mind that the combinations must be only series or only parallel. The easiest way is to start furthest from the capacitor and work your way there.\nInternal Resistance\nWe've separated devices into groups of resistors and conducting wire. However, this is a false dichotomy. All materials have some amount of internal resistance which resists current. Typically, batteries and wires have extremely low resistance to facilitate current.\nKirchhoff's Rules\nIf resistors are in series or parallel, we can combine them fairly easily. There's trouble when we can't do that, however. We must use Kirchhoff's Rules, specifically the junction rule and the loop rule to calculate resistance in these cases.\nThe junction rule states that the total current directed into a junction must equal the total current directed out of the junction. This is just an extension of conservation of electric charge that we discussed earlier. You can imagine an intersection of cars where you have four cars waiting at the light. They can either turn right or go straight. Either way they go, however, there must be four cars that are leaving the intersection unless something has gone horribly wrong.\nThe loop rule relates a similar idea but in relation to electric potential. The voltage rises at every capacitor, and it must have drops through every resistor that equal the rise through the resistor. For example, after a 12 V rise through a capacitor, a pass through a 5 Ω and a 1 Ω resistor must drop 10 V and 2 V respectively in order to have it be the same.\nSome important notes:\n\n\nthe choice of direction is arbitrary, we will simply end up with a negative current if it is wrong\n\n\nwe must indicate the positive and negative directions of every capacitor/resistor in order to find our voltage drops/rises\n\n\nour final equation will have the drops on one side and the rises on the other side, with every term either being voltage or a resistance multiplied by the variable \\(I\\)\n\n\nthe answer is \\(I\\) which is solved for through normal algebra\n\n\n\nIn laboratory, there are various devices we use to measure current and voltage. You should remember that current is only the same in series and voltage is only the same in parallel. Therefore, ammeters must be connected in series and voltmeters in parallel.\n\nCapacitors in Series/Parallel\nCapacitors work opposite to resistors when they are in series and in parallel. They add up charge simply when placed in parallel, and have the inverse reciprocal relationship when placed in series. The reason this happens is because charge and capacitance are directly related while current and resistance are inversely related.\nOne note is that with regards to the charges on their plates, capacitors in series always have charges of the same magnitude because they will equalize out.\nRC Circuits\nWe often have circuits that have both resistors and capacitors. In this situation, the capacitor's time to charge depends on the resistance:\n$$q = q_0[1 - e^{-t/(RC)}]$$\n\\(RC\\) here is very simply, the resistance multiplied by the capacitance, which ends up being a unit in seconds known as \\(τ\\), the time constant. That is the amount of time for the capacitor to charge to 63.2%, which is \\(1 - e^{-1}\\).\nDischarging works with a similar equation:\n$$q = q_0e^{-t/(RC)}$$\nwhere \\(τ\\) represents losing 63.2% charge.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/circuits/","title":"Circuits"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/cpu-virtualization/":{"body":"We need a way to map on to the physical CPU through our operating system. We do this through virtualization.\nProcesses\nA process is an execution stream in the context of a process state. It is a self-contained stream of executing instructions on the CPU. Each process has a state which is composed by everything that the code can affect or be affected by, for example registers, address space, open files, etc. We need this state so that we can pause and resume processes without resetting the whole thing, just by picking up where the state left off.\nYou can think of address space as the region of memory in which the CPU operates, though this is a simplification due to memory virtualization.\nA process is technically different than a program. When we talk about a program, it's usually a collection of files on our computer. The process refers to the actually executing code which is dynamic with respect to its code. We can have multiple processes executed that are the same program.\nProcesses do not share information with other processes. This is distinct from the idea of threads. If a process examines the \"same\" memory address with respect to its address space as another process, they will see different values. Even though both process are looking at 0xFFE84264 the memory virtualization means that they are looking at different physical memory. Threads share data so they have the same address space; they are in a way a lightweight process.\nAddress Space\nAs mentioned, every process has its own address space. The OS assigns a chunk of memory towards it (again, this memory is virtual). At the high address, there is a stack of local variables that grows downwards. This stack contains the execution of the program, such as functions being called. The code segment which is the actual program is read from the absolute bottom. There are a few segments like .data and .bss which refer to global initialized/uninitialized variables, respectively. Then there is the heap, which is dynamic and grows upward. Usually, the heap is much larger than the stack because it contains allocated memory for the process.\n\nThe stack and the heap grow towards each other, so you might think they would collide at some point. In reality, there is a wide enough chasm between them that if they collide, you have bigger problems to worry about.\n\nCPU Virtualization\nOur problem is that a CPU can only execute one execution stream at one time. We want processes to be running at the same time, so how do we achieve the illusion that the process has full control of the CPU?\nOne solution is direct execution. We will run the process as simply as possible and execute all of its instructions in sequence. This is extremely simple to implement, but it means we can only run one process at once. If the process runs forever, then the CPU is stuck. Processes might write to other data that it's not supposed to, or do some slow I/O operation, or execute privileged instructions it's not allowed to accesss. In general, we don't want to trust processes to behave. Operating systems use limited direct execution, which maintains some control over the execution of the process instead of giving it unfettered access to the CPU.\nSystem Calls\nWe want to make sure user process can't harm other processes. CPU hardware supports privilege levels for security reasons. These instructions should only be run in kernel space by the operating system, and user processes in user space can not access them. Privileges can have multiple levels. In order for processes to access privileges, we use system calls that can either pass the function off to the OS or give the process privilege, also known as a trap.\nID1 = syscall(SYS_getpid); // syscall\n\nID2 = getpid(); // call to libc\n\nLet's say a process wants to execute read(), which is a syscall. It will move the syscall ID for read 0x6 into the %eax register for execution, then run the instruction syscall.  The operating system will then read the trap table to figure out what to do. The trap table is located in the hardware, which typically has an entry for system calls. Other traps could be illegal access for memory region that it doesn't have access to. A trap just refers to a hardware operation that triggers on some software interaction. This is why Javascript can't just randomly hack your computer from the internet; it is executing within a user process e.g. Chrome and is limited by the hardware traps in what it can do.\nMultiprogramming\nWe want to make sure that multiple processes can run at once. This means we must switch between processes. There are two components to this; how to switch, and when to switch.\nThe dispatch loop has a simple structure, but the devil is in the details.\nwhile (1) {\n    // run process A for some time-slice\n    // stop process A and save its context\n    // CONTEXT SWITCH\n    // load context of another process B\n}\n\nWe have multiple ways to context switch. One way is cooperative multi-tasking. We trust the process to give up the CPU when it has judged some amount of work has been done or time has passed. We will provide yield() syscall for magnanimously donating CPU time to another process. However, this is annoying to program in, so most programs do not do this.\nModern programs use true multi-tasking, which gives OS control over which processes are running. The hardware will generate a timer interrupt every 10 ms, for example (Linux) that the OS will decide when to switch or not.\nPCB\nThe process control block is a descriptor of a process that saves its context into a struct. There is a struct for every process that is running in the CPU. A PCB stores the following information:\n\n\nPID -  unique identification for a process\n\n\nProcess state (enum running, ready, or blocked)\n\n\nExecution state (registers at time of pause)\n\n\nScheduling priority\n\n\nAccounting information (parent/child procs)\n\n\nCredentials (resource access/owner)\n\n\nFile pointers\n\n\nWhen we save the context of the process in the dispatch loop, the PCB is where it is saved. It is typically less than a few kilobytes depending on the complexity of the process. The PCB is stored on the kernel stack which is a stack data structure located in kernel space. Switching a context means moving the stack pointer to the process that is going to resume and then retrieving that PCB from the stack. Then, we exit kernel space and resume executing B in user space by restoring the PCB information to the CPU.\nWhen a process is doing I/O, it's not using the CPU. This is an excellent point where the OS can block the process and run some other processes that actually need the CPU. Once the I/O is done, it is moved from the blocked state to the ready state. The convention is that only ready state programs can go to the running state.\nProcess Creation\nOne way to create a process is just creating one from scratch. We will load the code we're running into memory at the bottom of the stack and create the stack. We also create a PCB with a kernel stack and everything, then put the process in the ready state. However, there are lots of complicated parts of processes that are difficult to initialize from scratch e.g. permissions, I/O, environment vars so this is generally not preferred.\nA better way is to clone an existing process and change it to the appropriate information. fork() clones the calling process and exec(char *file) replaces the current process with the new process.\nWhen we fork, we save the current state of the program as a new PCB that is added to the kernel stack, which is very optimized to use copy-on-write semantics.\n\nThe basic idea of copy-on-write is that it uses a pointer/reference for memory until we need to modify memory. This is an incremental process that trades off some overhead for a pay-as-you-go memory saving system.\n\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/cpu-virtualization/","title":"CPU Virtualization"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/curry/":{"body":"Currying is the concept of having multiple arguments in a function. OCaml defaults to currying its functions. int -&gt; int -&gt; int is a function that takes two ints and returns an int.\n\nThe -&gt; is right-associated and the function application is left-associated. The last element of the function definition is always the return type, but calling a function always counts arguments from the left.\nlet f a b = a / b;;\nlet f = fun a -&gt; (fun b -&gt; a / b);;\n\nThese two lines are equivalent because the second line is just the uncurried function separated into two parts. The fun lambda only has one argument, and the -&gt; keyword is right-associated so b is considered part of the arguments.\nCurrying allows you to pass only a portion of the expected arguments to the function, the same way that Python uses keyword arguments.\nAnother way to enable multiple arguments is by using a tuple that contains both arguments, which are destructured in the function definition. However, the advantage of currying is that you can separate the call of the function from the arguments.\nlet add a b = a + b;;\nlet addthree = add 3;;\naddthree 4;; (* evaluates to 7 *)\n\nThis code allows addthree to exist as an implementation of add with a specific argument already given.\nHowever, it's not all roses with currying. Function need to retain state regardless of stack state, so the local variable 3 that is temporarily in the function addthree may not always be there. Anonymous functions may not have the same call stack.\nIn C-like languages, local variables are contained within their own stack frames. When a function calls another function, the new stack frame that is created contains its own local variables. If a variable is declared, then initialized through a function call, that variable contains junk until the function returns.\nIf we return a function that references a local variable in another function, reading it off the stack can get confusing. The first variable you look for is still uninitialized, so you need to evaluate where that variable is coming from to understand.\nWe solve this problem using static scoping. Nonlocal names refer to their nearest binding in the program text. This is also known as lexical scoping. If two variables have the same name in an inner scope and an outer scope, then we read the one in the inner scope first.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/curry/","title":"Currying Arguments in a Function"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/data-types/":{"body":"When we make our programs more and more complex, we need more complex data types as well. We have only used OCaml's built-in data types, how can we construct our own data types?\ntype\nThe type keyword is similar to the typedef keyword in C, except more limited in scope. A type can only be multiple variants of arbitrary values.\n(* coin is enum with variants Heads and Tails*)\ntype coin = Heads | Tails\n\nEach variant can also contain data of other data types.\ntype shape =\n | Rect of float * float\n | Circle of float\nlet r = Rect (3.0, 4.0) (* r has type shape *)\n\nshape here has two variants. It can either be a tuple of two floats when it is a Rect, or it can be a single float when it is a Circle.\nThese data types are also known as algebraic data types or tagged unions.\nOption\nADTs can be useful when we want to ensure the complete handling of all cases. For example, if an object is nullable, it is useful to make sure that we must handle the null case instead of passing that off to the developer who might carelessly not handle it. This is where the option type comes from.\ntype 'a option =\n | Some of 'a\n | None\n\nThe 'a keyword means that that the type option is polymorphic, and the variant Some will contain whatever type that option is defined for. When handling an option, you must destructure it into its Some and None variants and handle both cases, otherwise OCaml will warn you for a non-exhaustive pattern match.\nList\nWe can actually define our own list data type as a recursive data type, which is a data type which contains itself.\ntype 'a list =\n | Nil\n | Cons of 'a * 'a list\n\nHere, list has two variants, Nil and a Cons tuple of an element and a list. If we think of the traditional list data type, this is actually just a more verbose version.

However, managing disks is not as simple as it might appear on a surface level.\nI/O\nBefore we dive deep into disks, we must first consider the general concept of input/output, or I/O. This is a general class of devices which externally connect to the computer and provide input and output. They include keyboards, mice, displays, speakers, etc. and are essential to any typical use of a computer.\nAll of these devices are very different, so how does the operating system communicate with each of them? In order to talk to external devices, the OS treats every device as a canonical device with three components: a status register, a command buffer, and a data buffer.\nThe status register tells the OS what the current status of the device is. There might be many types of status for a device, but the basic one we will consider is BUSY. If a device is busy, the OS will not command it to do anything and will wait until it is free. Once it's free, the OS will put a command in the command buffer, and optionally some relevant data in the data buffer. The device will become busy again performing the command that the OS has given it.\nNote that the device here is agnostic to the actual use of the device. The OS uses the same general procedure for every device.\nOne nice thing about I/O theoretically is that because its duties are separate from the computer, it can perform operations while the CPU is busy doing something else, increasing performance. However, this might not necessarily be the case. In order to initiate I/O, the CPU must, as previously stated, modify the command and data buffers. This can use up valuable CPU time.\nIn order to mitigate this, most computers have a separate DMA engine for direct memory access. This engine will communicate with I/O while the CPU is busy doing something else.\nAlthough we do have this canonical device, the computer still needs to know what the different commands are and the type of data to put into the hardware. In order to communicate with the hardware effectively, all modern operating systems use device drivers. These are essentially low-level wrappers to the device which provide a convenient API for operating systems to use. In fact, almost all code in an operating system is devoted to these device drivers!\nHard Disks\nFor most of computing history, HDDs or hard disk drives have been the hardware for persistent storage, and their internal structure is important to making sure they are performant. Recently, SSDs or solid state drives have increased in popularity for faster storage access. However, they are still expensive for large amounts of data and HDDs are still used commonly, so let's discuss them.\nThe basic hardware for a hard disk is a platter with several rotating wheels and an arm which moves between each wheel. Most hard disks are composed of thousands of such platters. Each wheel is sectioned into blocks of data. In order  to access the data, the arm must seek the correct wheel and the wheel must rotate to bring the correct data block for the arm to read, which will transfer the data to the computer. These three steps form the basis of reading and writing from a hard disk. Seeking and rotating are slow and tend to be the bottleneck of access, while transferring is typically fast. The time taken for I/O is defined as\n$$\nT_{I/O} = T_{seek} + T_{rotation} + T_{transfer}\n$$\nand the rate of I/O is\n$$\nR_{I/O} = \\frac{Size_{Transfer}}{T_{I/O}}\n$$\nThese facts mean that when composing data, we want to reduce the amount of seeks and rotations as much as possible. This makes sequential data very important. When data is accessed sequentially, it tends to be on the same wheel and next to each other, so no seeks and very little rotation needs to be done.\nScheduling\nLike with CPU cycles, disk requests can also be scheduled and reordered. This becomes important when trying to optimize for sequential data instead of random access.\nThe most obvious way to schedule a disk is to schedule requests that have the shortest seek time from the current wheel, so either on the same wheel or a close-by one. This increases performance, but it will starve requests that happen to be far away. We want to have some amount of fairness in our scheduling.\nThe currently accepted way to do this is SCAN or C-SCAN, also known as the elevator method. Essentially, the disk will be swept from beginning to end to check for any requests. If there is a request, then it will be performed. This preserves sequential data as the sweep goes in order, but makes sure that far away requests are also done. C-SCAN is an improvement over SCAN. Where SCAN simply goes back and forth like a real elevator, C-SCAN will treat the disk like a circle and sweep in the same direction. This prevents the sectors at the ends from being starved.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/disks/","title":"Disks"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/dns/":{"body":"Protocols\nWe need protocols to define the way that messages are interpreted.\nMessages are different based on what kind of information you are sending. For example, HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol) defines the way that webpages are served. Otherwise, the bytes that are sent between a client and a server are meaningless.\nIdentification\nWe can identify hosts using IP addresses and ports.\nWith cell phones, we use telephone numbers to identify each other and call each other. Sometimes, we can store names in contacts associated with the phone numbers that are easier to remember than unique numbers.\nIP addresses work the same way. Each IP address uniquely identifies a host then can send and receive information through a network. IPv4 is a 32-bit number that was traditionally used, however due to its limited scope (only $2^{32}$ ≈ 4 billion possible IP addresses). IPv6 is the new type of address that is 128-bit number with $2^{128}$ possible  addresses.\nIPv4: 128.6.24.78\nIPv6: 2001:4000:A000:C000:6000:B001:412A:8000\nThere can be more than one application running on a host, however. They can't interfere with each other, so we need a way to distinguish them. This is done via port numbers, which are 16-bit numbers that can be bound to applications that communicate over the network. Some port numbers are reserved for special purposes, such as port 25 for email, port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS. Port numbers are like different employees that work at a call center.\nBoth client and server must identify each other's IP address and port numbers: a 4-tuple: $(S_{IP}, S_{P\\#}, D_{IP}, D_{P\\#})$ This tuple is a uniquely defined bidirectional connection.\nThe OS manages a simple data structure of port numbers to track which are in use, no complexity involved.\nClient-Server Architecture\nMany clients communicate with one always-on server.\nA server is a host that is always on and has a permanent IP address that is often public. For large servers, it is often necessary to use server farms that distribute servers geographically for faster communication across the globe.\nA client is one of many hosts that makes a connection with the server to access data on the server. They might connect intermittently or have dynamic IP addresses. Clients do not communicate with one another directly, instead using the server as a medium.\nFor example, a website server might listen on a fixed, public IP address at port 80, waiting for a HTTP request. A client might request a webpage from this server and make a connection with its own IP address and port 80. Many clients will all have different connection tuples because of their own unique IP addresses. This way, many clients can make connections without confusing the server.\nOne domain name can map to different IP addresses. This is how google.com can be split across thousands of servers that serve billions of requests every day to the exact same domain. The domain name can be thought of as a contact with saved name that might have many phone numbers.\nDNS\nDomain names are converted to IP addresses through the DNS.\nDNS is the Domain Name System which acts as a service to resolve IP addresses from a normal alphanumeric domain name, just like a telephone book. The DNS is itself an online service that must be accessed through a network.\nThe DNS listens on port 53 and the IP address is well-known. A simple DNS might be a large centralized database of names and IP addresses, around 4 billion for IPv4.\nHowever, if this DNS crashes, that would destroy the whole Internet. Also, everybody on the Internet would be trying to access this server, which place tremendous load. It would be a big security issue and a large target for attack, both physical and virtual. Lookup in a server with billions of entries would be slow. Latency for hosts that are physically far away would be greatly increased depending on the server location. Every new host would need to be entered in the same location, which would be slow. This does not scale!\nReal DNS is implemented as a distributed service across different countries. Top-level domains like .com, .org, .edu, are most popular and are the main domain names that people access. Each country also has it's own top-level domain server named after it, like .de, .uk, .be. Many websites nowadays utilize country codes for special names that include the domain name e.g. youtu.be.\nSecond-level servers are the most commonly accessed domain names, like amazon.com, google.com, etc. These names are separated by periods, from right to left.\nLarger domain names like universities can be further namespaced, like cs.rutgers.edu. Rutgers University has its own DNS server that manages these additional domain names. The final name that contains the actual data is called the authoritative domain.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/dns/","title":"DNS Explained"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/electric-potential/":{"body":"Besides electrical charge and field, there's another force that is relevant to electricity: electric potential.\nPotential Energy\nGravity is similar to the electrostatic force, apart from the fact that it acts on mass instead of electric charge. The equations are practically identical. We're familiar with the idea of gravitational potential energy; why not apply the concept to charge as well?\nRecall that work is expressed as the difference between potential energy. The equation for work done by an electric force is:\n$$W_{AB} = EPE_A - EPE_B$$\nwhere \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the positions that the charges are in.\nElectric Potential Difference\nRemember that the electric force depends on the small test charge \\(q_0\\). If we divide all parts of the previous equation by \\(q_0\\), then we get the work per-unit-charge.\nFor the first time, we're going to be talking about electric potential, expressed in volts \\((V)\\). This is different from electric potential energy, which is expressed in joules (\\(J)\\). The equation for electric potential derived from EPE is \\(V = \\frac{EPE}{q_0}\\), showing that volts are the same as joule/coulomb.\n\\(V\\) can only truly be measured as \\(ΔV\\), becuase it is relative measurement in terms of work, similar to energy. This potential difference \\(ΔV\\) is known as voltage. When we talk about voltage in common parlance, that is the electric potential difference between two charges, typically the terminals of a capacitor.\nWe can think of positives and negatives here like gravity. Because electricity flows from positive to negative, that's the direction of \"gravity\". Positive charges accelerate to lower electric potential like massive objects accelerate to lower heights. Negative charges oppose this acceleration like the normal force to higher electric potential.\nYou might have also seen the unit \\(eV\\), \\(MeV\\), or \\(GeV\\) with reference to energy. This is the unit electron-volt, which is, as implied, the charge of an electron multiplied by one volt. This value is \\(1.60 × 10^{-19} J\\), and the mega and giga versions are six and nine order magnitudes greater than it, respectively.\nVolts and Point Charges\nIf we apply this concept to the point charges we have discussed, we get a pretty simple formula:\n$$ΔV = \\frac{-W_{AB}}{q_0} = \\frac{kq}{r_B} - \\frac{kq}{r_A}$$\nAnd in order to determine \\(V\\) for the \\(q\\) at just point \\(A\\), we consider point \\(B\\) to be infinitely far away and eliminate it, leaving us with the final potential equation:\n$$V = \\frac{kq}{r}$$\nNote here that \\(q\\) is not absolute. \\(V\\) will have the same sign as \\(q\\).\nLike with electrostatic force, we can calculate \\(V\\) with respect to many point charges by adding them together, minding our signs .\nWe can calculate electric potential energy for multiple point charges in a similar way by adding together every pair EPE \\(\\frac{kq_1q_2}{r}\\).\nEquipotential Surfaces\nAn equipotential surface is one where the electric potential is the same everywhere. Think of a hollow sphere which surrounds a point charge. Every point on that surface is the same distance from the charge and so will have the same electric potential.\nIf you have a charge on an equipotential surface, then no work is done on it by the net electric force if it moves along it. This is because the potential is the same everywhere, looking at the equations from earlier.\nOn the same equipotential sphere, the electric field is perpendicular to the surface and points to decreasing potential, like gravity. The most clear example of this is a parallel plate capacitor. If we try to calculate the electric field from electric potential, it is simply\n$$E = -\\frac{ΔV}{Δs}$$\nwhere \\(Δs\\) is an expression of displacement, like distance. This is what we would use to find the electric field or distance for a parallel plate capacitor.\nCapacitors and Dielectrics\nWe have already discussed one kind of capacitor, the parallel plate capacitor. A capacitor is simply two conductors placed close together, which are not touching. There will often be an insulator placed in between them called a dielectric.\nThe capacitor stores electric charge, with the positive plate having more electric potential. That potential difference is the voltage of the capacitor, although the plates have the same charge.\nThe magnitude \\(q\\) of the charge on each plate of a capacitor is directly proportional to the magnitude \\(V\\) of the potential difference between the plates:\n$$q = CV$$\nwhere \\(C\\) is the capacitance in farad \\((F)\\).\nAs you can tell from the equation, capitance is coulomb/volt and it represents how well the capacitor can store charge. Like coulombs, it is typically expressed in smaller forms like \\(μF\\) and \\(pF\\) which are six and twelve orders of magnitude less.\nWe can increase capacitance by adding a dielectric in the capacitor. The molecules in the dielectric will form dipole moments oriented towards the positive and negative plate as appropriate. These dipole moments will stop the electric field from passing through the dielectric, and instead some of it will begin and end at the surface. This reduces the strength of the electric field and allows it to store more charge.\nThe equation for capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor based on the dielectric constant \\(κ\\) is:\n$$C = \\frac{κε_0A}{d}$$\nThere is also work done to fill a capacitor with charge, because it stores energy. The work done by a battery, for example, to fill up a capacitor's charge is expressed in multiple ways as:\n$$Energy = \\frac{1}{2}qV = \\frac{1}{2}CV = \\frac{q^2}{2C} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{κε_0A}{d})(Ed)^2$$\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/electric-potential/","title":"Electric Potential"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/electromagnetic-waves/":{"body":"We have discussed electric fields and magnetic fields, and the way that they change and interact. The full interaction of these fields will create electromagnetic waves, the study of which will consume the rest of these notes.\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum\nIt's easiest to understand electromagnetic waves (EM waves) in the same way that we understand any other waves, through frequency \\(f\\) or wavelength \\(λ\\).\n\nThroughout these notes, we will refer almost exclusively to the wavelength of an EM wave as identification for consistency's sake. Note however that this is always mapped to a corresponding frequency, though inversely related.\n\nVisible light is an EM wave, with wavelengths in the hundreds of nanometers. Stronger EM waves like X-rays or gamma rays go from \\(10^{-8}\\) to \\(10^{-16}\\) meters, which is extremely small! In contrast, weaker EM waves like radio waves can have wavelengths in the thousands of meters. As you can see, EM waves have a broad spectrum.\nThe wavelength of an EM wave in a vacuum is given by \n$$\nfλ = c\n$$\nwhere \\(c\\) is the well-known speed of light at \\(3 × 10^{8}\\) meters per second. \\(c\\) can also be more precisely defined as\n$$\nc = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ε_0μ_0}}\n$$\nwhere \\(ε_0\\) is the permittivity of free space \\(8.85×10^{-12}\\) and \\(μ_0\\) is the permeability of free space \\(4π×10^{-7}\\).\nEnergy\nEM waves transport energy, and that energy has a certain value depending on the electric and magnetic fields that created the EM wave. The electric energy density is:\n$$\nu_E=\\frac{1}{2}ε_0E^2\n$$\nIn contrast, the magnetic energy density is given by:\n$$\nμ_B=\\frac{1}{2μ_0}B^2\n$$\nNotice the different units here. The electric energy density is dependent on permittivity, while the magnetic energy density is dependent on the inverse permeability.\nWe can combine these two to get the total energy density:\n$$\nu = \\frac{1}{2}ε_0E^2 + \\frac{1}{2μ_0}B^2 = ε_0E^2 = \\frac{B^2}{μ_0}\n$$\nThe direction of the wave must always be mutually perpendicular to the direction to the electric field and the magnetic field. This follows the right hand rule where the thumb is the magnetic field \\(B\\), the pointer finger is the propagation of the wave, and the middle finger is the electric field \\(E\\). You can remember this because the pointer finger points to where the wave is going, and \\(B\\) comes before \\(E\\) in the alphabet, so the first one is the thumb and the second is the middle finger.\n\nAn EM wave has a magnetic field with an rms value of \\(3.40 × 10^{-6} T\\). The wave passes perpendicularly through an opening that has an area of \\(0.35 m^2.\\)\nTo get the electric field value \\(E\\), we multiply the magnetic field \\(B\\) by \\(c\\) to get \\(3 × 10^8\\ m/s\\ •\\ 3.4 × 10^{-6} T = 1020\\ N/C\\).\nTo get the energy densities \\(μ_E\\) and \\(μ_B\\), we simply apply the earlier formulas here.\n$$\nμ_E = \\frac{1}{2}ε_0E^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(8.85×10^{-12})(1020)^2 = 4.604 × 10^{-6} J/m^3\n$$\n$$\nμ_B = \\frac{B^2}{2μ_0} = \\frac{(3.4×10^{-6})^2}{2\\ •\\ 4π×10^{-7}} = 4.6×10^{-6} J/m^3\n$$\nAfter getting the electric energy density and the magnetic energy density, getting the total energy density is as simple as adding them together to get \\(9.204×10^{-6}\\ J/m^3).\nThe intensity of a wave is a simple equation; you can think of it as the density multiplied by speed being how much is being transferred per unit time: \\(S = cu\\).\n$$\nS = cu = (3×10^8 m/s)(9.204×10^{-7} J/m^3) = 2761.2 W/m^2\n$$\nLet's say we want to find the energy that is carried through this opening over twenty seconds. Energy is in the unit joules \\(J\\) and \\(W\\) is \\(J/s\\). In order to convert a dimensions properly, we're going to need multiply the intensity by \\(s\\ •\\ m^2\\). With this in mind, it's clear how we should form our equation. We're multiplying the density by the time passed (20 seconds) and the area \\(0.35 m^2\\).\n$$\nE = StA = (2761.2 W/m^2)(20 s)(0.35 m^2) = 19328.4\\ J\n$$\n\nPolarization\nElectromagnetic waves can be polarized in a a particular direction by passing throw a material which only allows for one vector to pass through.

The positive charge comes from protons, also in the atom. The unit of the charge is the Coulomb (\\(C\\)). An electron has a charge of \\(-1.60×10^{-16} C\\), and a proton has the same charge but positive. However, the proton is much heavier than an electron, being about 1836 times as massive. This means that electrons are easy to displace, which is why their movement is the fundamental concept behind electricity.\nThe way that electric charge is generated is by rubbing two materials together in a way that transfers electrons between the two. For example, if you rub your clothes against a shag carpet, it will transfer electrons to your clothes.\nHowever, charge is neither created nor destroyed, due to the law of conservation of electric charge!\nAs you might already know from playing around with magnets, like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other. This attraction is known as the electrostatic force.\nConductors/Insulators\nElectric charge is not limited to its power to attract and repel. It can also move through objects; this is how electricity travels from power plants to your house, through wires. Not all materials are created equal in their ability to conduct electricity through them. Those that conduct poorly are called electrical insulators and those that can well are called electrical conductors. This material property is typically related to how easily valence electrons can move around in the molecules of the material.\nCharging by Contact/Induction\nI said before that electrical charge can be generated by rubbing, for example against a shag carpet. This is known as charging by contact. However, this is not the only way to charge an object. As we know, electrons can be attracted and repelled. If a negatively charged object is brought close to a neutrally charged object, the electrons in the neutrally charged object will be repelled to the other side, changing the distribution of charge in the object. This is known as charging by induction because the electrons are induced by the charge to move.\nThis effect will disappear when the inducing object leaves, unless we introduce grounding. A grounding wire is a way to disappear free electrons from a charged object. Typically, an object is wired to a large diffuse object such as the earth, so free electrons will leave the small object forever. In the example I used above, if there is a grounding wire attached to the other side where the electrons were repelled to, then those electrons would \"disappear\". After the inducing object leaves, the formerly neutral object would become positively charged.\nThis can even occur in materials like plastic which are insulating. Although the free electrons cannot move as in materials like metals, positive charges can still be induced towards the surface, allowing for a surface positive charge that negatively charged objects to stick to.\nCoulomb's Law\nThe magnitude \\(F\\) of the electrostatic force exerted by one point charge \\(q_1\\) on another point charge \\(q_2\\) is directly proportional to the magnitudes \\(|q_1|\\) and \\(|q_2|\\) of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance \\(r\\) between them:\n$$ F = k\\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^2} $$\nwhere \\(k\\) is a proportionality constant: \\(k = 8.99 × 10^9 N \\cdot m^2/C^2\\) in SI units.\nSo what does this law mean? Crucially, this law gives no mention of direction. The magnitude of the force is the same regardless of whether the charges attract or repel, so we don't need to worry about that.\n\nThe constant \\(k\\) is sometimes written as \\(k = 1/(4πε_0)\\) where \\(ε_0\\) is the permittivity of free space with the value \\(8.85 × 10^{-12} C^2/N \\cdot m^2\\).\n\nA Coulomb is an absolutely massive amount of charge that is typically only found in situations like lightning. It is far more common to encounter microcoulombs expressed as \\(μC\\) which are \\(10^{-6} C\\).\nThis is a situation that is expressed between only two point charges. What happens when we have multiple point charges? We have to calculate the vector sum of all these forces.\nThis is easiest when all the charges are in a line, as this is simply a matter of adding and subtracting the forces depending on whether they are attractive or negative. We must calculate Coulomb's law for each pair and then combine those as appropriate.\nWhen we have points on a plane, things get a little more complicated. The easiest way to handle this is by separating each force into its \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components. Pick one point to be set at the angle 0° degrees with respect to the point we are calculating for, then set the \\(θ\\) for each other point with respect to that line. Then, get \\(F_x\\) and \\(F_y\\) through \\(\\cos{θ}\\) and \\(\\sin{θ}\\), respectively. The point with 0° will only have an \\(x\\) component.\nThen, once you have the \\(F_x\\) and \\(F_y\\) all parcelled out according to positives and negatives, get the total \\(F\\) by applying the Pythagorean theorem to them. The answer \\(θ\\) is given by \\(\\tan^{-1}{\\frac{F_y}{F_x}}\\).\nThe Electric Field\nWe have so far been talking about how individual point charges affect other point charges. When we talk about an entire system of charges, we need a broader, high-level understanding of charge. For that purpose, the electric field is essential. Fundamentally, the electric field is defined as the electric force per coulomb \\(\\vec{E} = \\vec{F}/q_0\\). This calculation pretends that we have a small positive test charge \\(q_0\\) placed in the middle of this electric field, which is affected by the various charges to have a force pointing a direction. This test charge typically has a small magnitude so as not to disturb the surrounding field.\nThe electric field is independent of whatever point charge it's affecting. We could imagine a field with a magnitude \\(2.0 N/C\\) and direction upwards that causes a positive charge to go in the same direction as it, but a negative charge to go in the opposite direction. We can calculate the magnitude for each point charge with \\(F = |q_0|E\\).\nElectric fields, just like forces, are vectors. When we add fields together, we must equally be mindful of \\(E_x\\) and \\(E_y\\).\nAn electric field is composed of multiple point charges. The amount of electric field that an individual point charge \\(q\\) produces is expressed by the equation\n$$E = \\frac{k|q|}{r^2}$$\nNotice how \\(q_0\\) the test charge is not included in this equation. Since this new equation only expresses magnitude, we must individually determine direction by the sign of the charge. If \\(q\\) is positive, \\(\\vec{E}\\) is directed in the opposite direction of \\(q\\), and vice versa for negative.\nAn additionally useful equation relates to parallel plate capacitors. These are two parallel plates of opposite charge that have an electric field directed from the positive plate to the negative plate. The equation for this electric field is\n$$E = \\frac{q}{ε_0A} = \\frac{σ}{ε_0}$$\nAs you can see in this equation, the symbol \\(σ\\) denotes \\(q/A\\) and is sometimes called charge density. Importantly, the distance between the plates is actually totally irrelevant to the electric field, unlike with point charges.\nElectric Field Lines\nIt is often useful to draw fields as a set of lines directed out of or towards a point charge. In general, electric field lines are always directed away from positive charges and toward negative charges.\nFor convenience, we usually only draw them in two dimensions, though technically charges act in three dimensions. The number of lines is expressed as proportional the magnitude of the charge, so five times as many lines for five times the magnitude. In general, the electric field is stronger when lines are closer together, which is why parallel plate capacitors have the same electric field in the middle but bulge out at the ends.\nThe lines are not always straight, as in the case of an electric dipole. An electric dipole has two separated point charges of opposite signs and equal magnitude. The field lines in this case come from the positive charges and curve towards the negative charge, getting faster as they get closer. The electric field vector in this case is tangent to the electric field at any point. Between two charges of the same sign, there is practically no electric field because the lines curve away from each other.\nShielding\nElectric fields can exist anywhere where electrons can move freely, which includes the inside of a conductor. It's a logical conclusion: electrons hate being near each other, so they try to get away in the conductor. That leaves them all at the surface of the conductor. The same principle applies for positive charges; conductors generally have all their excess charge at their surface.\nHowever, since all the excess charge is at the surface, that means that in the interior of the conductor, there is no movement of free electrons because they're not there. This means that there is zero electric field inside a conductor.\nIf we imagine a conductor within a parallel plate capacitor, there is a lot of electric field going on. However, all of the charges are directed outside of it. Inside the conductor, any charge is completely shielded from the intense electric field outside the conductor.\nGauss' Law\nWe have so far discussed electric fields created by point charges. In fact, an electric field is often composed by multiple charges that are spread out, also known as a charge distribution. Understanding an electric field created by a charge distribution is significantly more complex and requires understanding electric flux.\nWe can think of flux on a high level as similar to a vector, with a direction and magnitude, but with the additional dimension of area. This concept will be important when discussing magnets.\nWe can consider the formula for a point charge as a special form of Gauss' Law which describes electric fields in general. Remember how we can substitute \\(1/(4πε_0)\\) for \\(k\\)? This means that our new equation is \\(E = q/4(πε_0r^2)\\). If we multiply both sides by \\(A\\) which is \\(4πr^2\\) for a sphere, then we get\n$$EA = \\frac{q}{ε_0}$$\nwhere \\(EA\\) is electric flux, also known as \\(Φ_E\\).\nHowever, we don't always have a nice, neat distribution of charge like in a sphere. A Gaussian surface can be arbitrarily shaped. We have to think of this similarly to how we think about integrals in calculus. If we take an arbitrarily small area \\(ΔA\\), it has an electric field that is essentially constant in magnitude and direction. The surface has a normal which is a line perpendicular to the surface. The angle \\(ϕ\\) is between the electric field vector and the normal. With all these variables, Gauss' Law is expressed as so:\nThe electric flux \\(Φ_E\\) through a Gaussian surface is equal to the net charge \\(Q\\) enclosed by the surface divided by \\(ε_0\\), the permittivity of free space:\n$$Σ(E \\cos{ϕ})ΔA = \\frac{Q}{ε_0}$$\nwith the left side being \\(Φ_E\\) in \\(N \\cdot m^2/C\\).\nThe flux has the same sign as \\(Q\\).\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/electrostatics/","title":"Electrostatics"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/floating-point-architecture/":{"body":"Floating point numbers are complicated enough in the abstract. How do systems programmers and hardware designers cope with the complexity of floating point?\nFloating Point Instructions\nIn the general computer architecture, CPUs function by executing a stream of instructions. The set of instructions is defined by the hardware model, such as x86 or ARM. Instructions are typically tiny operations that need to be done extremely often. Some examples of instructions are mov to move values in and out of memory, sub to subtract numbers in registers, etc. In order to speed up floating point operations, hardware can include floating point instructions instead of letting software handle it.\nMost of the time, instruction sets only allow floating point operations in the same precision. However, there is a useful optimization that is not often implemented in hardware. A hypothetical instruction to multiply two single precision numbers that results in a double precision number would be very useful. In particular, it would enable for the use of iterative improvement algorithms that would otherwise have compounding catastrophic cancellations if the precision was not increased temporarily.\nSubexpression Evaluation\nThe order of operations is very important for preserving invariants in floating point. For example, floating point numbers do not necessarily follow the associative property, so compilers that optimize out parentheses will exhibit undefined behavior.\nThis can also cause issues when numbers with different precisions are operated on. There are two solutions to this problem. One is the solution that languages like OCaml take where all values in an arithmetic expression must have the same type. This means that integers will never be implicitly cast to floating point when they are operated with them, because they are not allowed to be operated with them anyway. However, this can be an overly strict restriction on the types of programs that can be written.\nAnother solution is the one that C takes, which is to establish rules for subexpression evaluation while allowing mixed type expressions. K&amp;R C requires that every operation be done in double precision, but this can cause incompatibility between expressions and a stored value that are in different precisions.\nA better way to do subexpression evaluation is to set a tentative precision for each expression, then increase the precision as needed in the wider expression. However, this means that the precision of a sub-expression can change with the expression it is embedded in, which is potentially unexpected behavior for a programmer.\nIEEE Conformation\nLanguages like C conform to the IEEE specification, but the ways in which they do it can cause issues in implementation. If the exact rounding operation is implemented in hardware, then all the language has to do is call the appropriate instruction. \nHowever, there are some aspects of floating point that are harder to represent.  Floating point has a certain state associated with it, with rounding mode, flags, trap handlers, etc. This state must be read and written to, and must be preserved across subroutines.\nNaNs also cause issue. The reflexive property is typically taken as invariant since it is in integer math, but it can be disastrous with NaNs. One massive consequence of the inclusion of NaNs is that floating point numbers cannot have a total order. This is because NaNs are explicitly unordered with respect to other floating point numbers. This has cascading consequences for the implementation of comparison operators like &lt;, &gt;, and =.\n\"Optimization\"\nCompilers make many optimizations to programs in order to increase performance or reduce instruction count. These optimizations are usually made with certain invariants in mind so that the accuracy of the program is not affected. However, because floating point has different invariants than integer math, compilers can make mistakes when optimizing floating point math. For example,\nfloat ε = 1;\ndo {\n    ε = 0.5 * ε;\n} while (ε + 1 &gt; 1);\n\nwill estimate \\(ε\\). However, a compiler might notice that ε + 1 &gt; 1 for integer math is equivalent to ε &gt; 0 and make that optimization, without considering that the expression \\(ε ⊕ 1\\) has a special meaning that is different for floating point numbers than a test for positivity.\nIn general, many algorithms with floating point will exhibit expressions that, upon first blush, seem to be redundant in integer math. Having consideration for the ways in which floating point math can change values is important.\nExceptions\nTrap handlers are empowered to be able to access variables in programs. However, computers which have parallel arithmetic may not necessarily be able to easily identify which operation threw an exception. Trap handlers must also be able to identify programs.\nThe reordering of certain instructions can also cause issues. Compilers will often change the order of certain arithmetic instructions when they are exact so that the semantics don't change. However, if the operation traps, then it is not as easy to identify the operation that trapped, since the operation that happened in parallel will modify the trapped arithmetic.\nOne solution to this is presubstitution where a user that knows that an exception can create their own handler for an exception and substitute the value themselves beforehand. However, because it goes against IEEE-754, it's unlikely to be proliferated.\nAll this information comes from the landmark paper What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/floating-point-architecture/","title":"Floating Point Architecture"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/floating-point/":{"body":"Floating point representation is a complex topic full of nuance. To understand it, we must focus on the abstract method used to represent non-integer numbers.\nNumbers in Computers\nMath is infinite. Or at least it can be. Numbers like \\(5\\) can be represented finitely, but a number like \\(π\\) is not so simple to represent. \\(3.14159265358979\\dots\\) but that still isn't enough. It'll never be enough.\nUnfortunately, computers are not infinite. Although we would like to hold every digit of \\(π\\) in our computer's memory, the fact is that there will always be limits to how numbers can be represented in computers.\nIntegers are numbers like \\(3\\), \\(15\\), \\(-154\\), etc. They have no decimal point and can be negative. Representing these numbers in a computer is fairly simple, with the limit only being placed on the size of the number.\nHowever, not all real numbers play so nicely. How do we represent the value \\(12.5\\) in memory? We can't have half bits. Can we go infinitely precise on decimals, like \\(7.2028301324\\)? What about the size? How do we set these bounds?\nFloating Point\nWe have to have a different standard to define how these numbers will be represented in a computer. This standard is called floating point.\nGenerally, a floating point representation is composed of three parts: the base \\(β\\), the significand \\(p\\), and the largest/smallest allowed exponents \\(e_{max}\\) and \\(e_{min}\\). This is the complete formula for floating point (ignoring specific details):\n$$\n\\lceil \\log_2{(e_{max} - e_{min} + 1)} \\rceil + \\lceil \\log_2{β^p \\rceil + 1}\n$$\nFor example, let's say we had a floating point representation in base 2 which allowed for exponents of sizes up to \\(+128\\) and down to \\(-127\\), and had twenty-three bits of precision for the significand. This representation would need 32 bits.\nA number written in floating point representation might look like this:\n$$\n1.010001 × 2^{7}\n$$\nwhere the first part is the significand, the base of the exponent is the base, and it's raised to its exponent. Floating point numbers are written like scientific notation to be normalized, where there is only one nonzero digit in front of the decimal point—this will become important for IEEE 754.\nImprecision\nI mentioned bits of precision, which is finite. Some decimal numbers can't be represented by a finite amount of precision. For example, the number \\(0.3\\) is finitely representable in base 10, but becomes \\(\\overline{1.001} × 2^{-2}\\) in binary. This number will never be perfectly represented in binary, so we have to have approximations.\nIn order to understand how much error we encounter, we must be able to measure it. There are two techniques to measure error in floating point: ulps or \"units in the last place\" and relative error.\nLet's use an example here, with \\(β = 10\\) and \\(p = 3\\). We want to approximate \\(2.781828\\) to a floating point number with this precision. Since we can only encode 3 digits of precision, we end up with \\(2.78 × 10^0\\). If we imagine a special decimal point after the precision stops for floating point, then the difference between these two is \\(0.1828\\). This is difference for ulps. The closest floating point number can still have a ulps error of up to \\(\\frac{β}{2} \\cdot β^{-p}\\). This number is known as the machine epsilon \\(ε\\).\nRelative error is a familiar concept in most sciences. It is simply the difference between measured and actual, divided by the actual value. In this case, our floating point approximation \\(2.78 × 10^0\\) is the \"measured\" value and our real number \\(2.781828\\) is our actual value. In this case, it is \\(0.001828 / 2.781828 = 0.0006\\). Since this number can be small, it is often expressed in terms of \\(ε\\). In this example, \\(ε = 5 × 10^{-3} = 0.005\\) so our relative error is \\(0.13ε\\).\nSince we know the maximum ulp error for the closest floating point number, we should find the same for relative error. One difference about relative error is that it changes based on the size of the numbers, not just the absolute error in the significand. The largest possible error is \\(\\frac{β}{2}β^{-p} × β^e\\).\nHowever, the relative error changes based on the size of the real number in question, and all real numbers within the same exponent range will have this error. So, the relative error for a number closer to \\(1.0 × β^e\\) will be larger than for a number closer to \\(β × β^e\\). This variation is called wobble. The relative error is always bounded by \\(ε\\), as in the prior example. Depending on the significand, however, the wobble can be up to \\(β\\) for the same exponent. Crucially, this wobble can be expressed in either relative error or ulps, as long as the other is held fixed.\nTypically, relative error is used, because it is more useful for compounding operations whereas ulps can vary wildly within \\(β\\).\nAn important concept to understand here is contaminated digits. These are the least significant digits of a floating point number which may be error-prone and are therefore untrustworthy. The number of contaminated digits is \\(\\log_β{n}\\) where \\(n\\) is the factor of the relative error to \\(ε\\), like \\(0.13\\) in the earlier example.\nError Mitigation\nWe have found how to measure error; now how do we reduce it? One method is to use guard digits. When performing calculations, a computer can \"extend\" the calculation by a few digits so that the extended digits are contaminated by the floating point operation. These digits will then be rounded out of the final result, reducing the contamination of the result.\nWithout a guard digit, the relative error can be large as \\(β - 1\\), which can put every digit in error! However, adding just one guard digit bounds the relative error to less than \\(2ε\\)!\nAnother method is to reduce the number of cancellations. A cancellation occurs when nearby quantities are subtracted. When this happens, the most significant and uncontaminated digits cancel out and the less significant, more contaminated digits are left. Cancellations can seriously magnify rounding errors in a series of cancellations; this is called catastrophic cancellation. However, cancellation can also be benign. If the two quantities being subtracted are exactly known, then the subtraction will have a tiny relative error if done with a guard digit.\nSometimes, we can rearrange formulas to have less or more benign cancellations. For example, the formula \\(x^2 - y^2\\) has a catastrophic cancellation because \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\) both suffer from rounding error. However, this formula can be rearranged to \\((x ⊕ y) ⊗ (x ⊖ y)\\). The cancellation is now benign because \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are presumably exact values without rounding error yet.\n\nNotice that the operands in that formula are circled. This is a notation to indicate that these operations are performed by a computer and therefore may accrue rounding error, whereas the ordinary operands are used for exact calculations.\n\nHowever, the impact of making a cancellation benign can be limited if the inputs to the equation are already inexact. This is common when converting between decimal and binary numbers. It is always worth eliminating a cancellation, though.\nExact Rounding\nAlthough guard digits mitigate error, they will in many cases give a different value than the exactly rounded result. That is the result if the floating point number was computed exactly, then rounded to precision. Many algorithms require exact rounding to work properly.\nThe nature of rounding is controversial. The most commonly accepted rounding mode is round to even. This will round numbers that end in the half digit to whichever direction makes the number even. For example, \\(12.5\\) will round to \\(12\\), not \\(13\\) because \\(12\\) is even. This achieves the result of rounding up and down being equal chance for the half digit, 5 in this case.\nExact rounding is useful for holding certain invariants in floating point calculation. For example, one way to increase precision in calculations is to split a multiple precision number into an array of single precision numbers. Adding these numbers back together with exact rounding will recover the multiple precision numbers.\nWe can represent a multiplication of two double precision floating point numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) using this method. We can split \\(x\\) into \\(x_h\\) and \\(x_l\\), each of which are single precision, and \\(y\\) into \\(y_h\\) and \\(y_l\\) likewise. Then, we can represent the multiplication as so:\n$$\nx \\cdot y = (x_h + x_l)(y_h + y_l) = x_hy_h + x_hy_l + x_ly_h + x_ly_l\n$$\nIn this way, a multiplication of two double precision numbers can be represented as the sum of multiplications of single precision numbers. Because the numbers are exactly rounded, the number is completely recoverable. This means that double precision multiplication can be possible on a computer which only supports single precision multiplication.\nAll this information comes from the landmark paper What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/floating-point/","title":"Floating Point"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/ftp/":{"body":"Before we had Google Drive, users needed a way to access files from other people quickly and easily. The method for that was FTP.\nFTP\nThe point of the File Transfer Protocol, was, as is obvious, to transfer files between two hosts. Like HTTP, FTP operates between a server and client, each of which have their own filesystem that they want to access. It also creates a TCP connection which has certain verification steps to establish a connection that allows the client to copy files stored in the server or vice versa.\nUnlike HTTP however, FTP operates using two parallel connections, the control connection and the data connection. As the names imply, the control connection is used for verification and command information such as which file to get in which directory, and the data connection is the connection used to send the files. This is called an out-of-band connection, unlike HTTP and SMTP, which have the request information in a header in the same connection and are therefore in-band.\nThe session begins with a control connection initiated by the client to identify the user and commands. The server receives this information, and if it approves, it initiates a data connection with the client. Like HTTP 1.0, this is a non-persistent connection that is only open for the passing of a single file.\nThe nature of FTP authentication means that FTP must maintain state about the user account, unlike HTTP which is totally stateless by design. This introduces constraints on the number of simultaneous FTP connections.\nCommands\nFTP commands work like HTTP commands in request headers. They are ASCII and each lines ends with \\r\\n. Some example commands are:\n\n\nUSER username\n\n\nPASS password\n\n\nLIST: works like the ls command for the remote directory, sent over data connection\n\n\nRETR filename: retrieves the file from the remote directory, over data\n\n\nSTOR filename: stores the file from current directory into remote, over data\n\n\nEvery command has a corresponding reply with a status code, similar to HTTP status codes.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/ftp/","title":"FTP Explained"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/functions/":{"body":"A function takes arguments, performs operations using them, and returns a value. In OCaml, we can write functions like so\nlet rec fact n = (* the function is named fact and its arg is n *)\n    if n = 0 then 1\n    else n * fact (n - 1) ;;\n\nThis is a recursive function, so we must prepend the keyword rec to the name of the function. The reason for this is that the function name is not automatically in scope, so if we don't use that we won't necessarily know what fact refers to. rec adds the function name into scope.\nAs you can see, the declaration of a function is fairly similar to the declaration of a variable. In fact, we can use functions as variables in OCaml! This is because functions in OCaml are first-class functions.\nYou also might have noticed here that we haven't mentioned the type of anything. This is because the type of the function can be inferred, also known as type inference. This process is a normal part of type checking for correctness. The compiler itself will look for a type that the code is correct for. In this example, n is compared with an integer, so it must only be an int. The return type is n multiplied by its own return type, so that must also be int. The compiler can see without us telling it that the function is of type int -&gt; int.\nBut what is that int -&gt; int that I just wrote? That is the constructor for a function type. The last type indicates the return type, and all other types are the arguments in order. The function type float -&gt; int -&gt; float, for example, takes a float and int as its arguments and returns a float. Try looking at different OCaml functions and guessing its type as a fun exercise! :smile:\n\nAside: you might question why we couldn't just get a float as a result from the multiplication. The standard operands in OCaml only apply to int, and applying them to other types is an error. In order to add float, we must use +., not +.\n\nType checking works like a proof by contradiction. We assume that a function has some type, then check if there are any logical contradictions created by this assumption. If there are, then we reject this type.\nCalling a Function\nFunction calls (also known as applications) look very similar to function declarations; they are simply the name of the function followed by its arguments, no parentheses necessary. The type checking involved is that we check if every expression supplied as an argument corresponds to the same type as it's supposed to. We evaluate each expression from right to left to see if they're correct or not (though this doesn't matter unless you have side effects).\nOnce we find the value for each argument, we replace each argument in the function with its value, which creates an expression that can be evaluated to the final value.\n\nAside: Although we have type inference, we can use type annotations with OCaml. These increase the readability of code by making the type of the variable obvious: let (x : int) = 3\n\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/functions/","title":"Functions in OCaml"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/higher-order-functions/":{"body":"We can do a lot of cool things with functions besides calling them in OCaml.\nAnonymous Functions\nValues are a subset of expressions, as previously stated. All expressions can evaluate to values, but values are final.\nAnonymous functions are also values. Sometimes, it's more convenient not to create and name a whole new function for our purpose. Anonymous functions are ad hoc functions that exist as values in expressions. They are expressed using the keyword fun.\nlet y = fun x -&gt; x + 3\n\nThis might not seem to have much benefit compared to a full function definition, but it is very useful within let expressions. Since anonymous functions are values, not just expressions, they can be manipulated far more powerfully than even general expressions.\nlet y = (fun x -&gt; x + 1) 2 in\n(fun z -&gt; z - 2) y\n\nThis code might seem a little hard to parse, but it's easier to think about if we rewrite it to use traditional function definitions.\nlet f x =\n    x + 1\nlet g z =\n    z - 2\nlet y = f 2 in\ng y\n\nNow we can tell that y is 3 in the function g, which then evaluates to 1. However, the former code snippet is a much terser way to write this expression  if we don't need the functions f and g anymore.\nOne good way to think about it is that anonymous functions are to regular functions as literals are to variables. If we only need to use the value \"really_long_string\" once, we don't need to store it in a variable. On the other hand, it can be useful to store that literal in a variable s that is much shorter to write. Similarly, if we only need to use the function x -&gt; x + 1 once, we don't need to store it in a function variable.\nIn fact, this isn't even an analogy. Functions are first-class in OCaml, so regular functions are just variables that store anonymous functions:\nlet f x = body\n(* this is sugar for this *)\nlet f = fun x -&gt; body\n\nAnd in the same vein, we can name functions within let expressions in an anonymous ways.\nlet move l x =\n    let left x = x - 1 in\n    let right x = x + 1 in\n    if l then left x\n    else      right x\n;;\n(* same as *)\nlet move' l x =\n    if l then (fun y -&gt; y - 1) x\n    else      (fun y -&gt; y + 1) x\n\nNote also that the local variable in the anonymous function doesn't actually matter to the expression it's used in; this is a consequence of the shadowing rules of OCaml.\nThere are several functions in the standard library of OCaml that use higher order functions.\nMap\nmap is a function in the List module of OCaml. Like the name implies, this function maps a function onto every element of a list and returns that list. It has type ('a -&gt; 'b) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'b list.\nlet rec map f l =\n    match l with\n    | [] -&gt; []\n    | h :: t -&gt; (f h) :: (map f t)\n\nThis is a simple, yet powerful and useful function. That's why it is included in the List module, although it's trivial to write yourself.\nFold\nfold is another function in the List module in OCaml, that iterates over a list. The essential idea is that you have an accumulator variable that you want to get based on the values in a list. \nlet rec fold f acc l =\n    match l with\n    | [] -&gt; acc\n    | h :: t -&gt; fold f (f acc h) t\n\nFor example, this is a way to implement a sum function using fold.\nlet rec sum acc l =\n    match l with\n    | [] -&gt; acc\n    | h :: t -&gt; sum (acc + h) t\nsum 0 [2; 5; 100; 53];;\n(* same as *)\nfold (fun acc x -&gt; acc + x) 0 [2; 5; 100; 53];;\n\nIts type is ('a -&gt; 'b -&gt; 'a) -&gt; 'a -&gt; 'b list -&gt; 'a. We can deconstruct that and understand each part of the function. The initial function f applies the type 'b to 'a and returns 'a. Then for the next two arguments, we keep the same 'a accumulator and iterate over the 'b list.\nThe use of an accumulator makes fold very versatile, since you can put anything in there.\nWe can combine map and fold to create the map/reduce framework which can be massively parallelized. We first map a function over our list, then we reduce the list into a single accumulator value.\nThere is also an alternative version of fold called fold_right that works in reverse, which can be better for certain problems. However, it comes with steep performance cost: every recursive call builds a new stack frame. The original fold is able to optimize this call away by using tail recursion.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/higher-order-functions/","title":"Higher Order Functions in OCaml"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/http/":{"body":"HTTP is probably the most visible Internet protocol to end users. It appears (as well as its cousin, HTTPS) at the beginning of every URL we use to access the internet. But how does it work?\n\nHTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It defines the structure of messages that are passed between two programs: a client and a server. But before we talk about HTTP, let's clarify some vocabulary\nWeb Terminology\n\n\nobject - a file that has an associated URL\n\n\nWeb page - a document that consists of multiple objects, typically a base HTML file and other objects. The HTML file will reference other objects through a path.\n\n\nURL - address consisting of the following parts:\n\n\nprotocolhostnamepath name\nhttp://www.someSchool.edu/someDepartment/picture.gif\n\n\n\nWeb browser - an application such as Firefox or Chrome that acts as the client in HTTP\n\n\nWeb server - an application such as Apache that acts as the server in HTTP and houses the Web objects in question\n\n\nHTTP Low-Level\nUnder the hood, HTTP uses TCP to make a reliable connection between the server and client. The client and server both send requests and receive responses from their respective socket interfaces.\nWhen a file is sent, there is no information that the server inherently remembers about the HTTP connection. Because of this, HTTP is considered a stateless protocol. This is not always desirable. Sometimes, websites want to remember clients in order to ease use of a website. We will discuss workarounds later.\nConnections\nThe original HTTP 1.0 protocol was non-persistent. This means that every request made between a client and a server had its own connection that was opened and closed every time a request was made. Here's the process:\n\n\nA TCP connection is created between the client and server on port 80.\n\n\nAn HTTP request message is sent from the client to the server through the socket.\n\n\nThe server receives the message, retrieves the object that it is requesting, and sends the response message to the client through the socket.\n\n\nThe server \"closes\" the TCP connection (TCP will wait until it knows that the client has received the message)\n\n\nThe client receives the message and the connection terminates. It will extract the HTML file from the message and initiate a new request for each object referenced within, repeating these steps as needed.\n\n\nClearly, this method is inefficient. We are opening a TCP connection for every single request that is made between the same client and server. This inefficiency is mediated slightly by the ability to open serial TCP connections; typical web browsers open 5 to 10 parallel TCP connections. The response time for each connection is \\(2 \\cdot RTT + T_{trans}\\).\nHTTP 1.1 introduced persistent connections. In step 4, the server doesn't close the TCP connection after sending the response. The entire Web page is sent over the same TCP connection, and the requests can be pipelined for further performance gains. The connection is typically closed on timeout. HTTP/2 further builds on this by interleaving requests and responses in the same connection with a way to preserve ordering on each end.\nMessage Format\nGET /http HTTP/1.1\nHost: sharifhsn.github.io\nConnection: close\nUser-agent: Mozilla/5.0\nAccept-language: fr\n\nThe Host line is technically unnecessary, since the connection is already established by this point, but it's useful for Web proxy caches. The Connection line means this connection should be non-persistent. The User-agent line specifies the user agent, which is the browser type that is making the request to the server. This is used so that the server can send different websites to different browsers. Accept-language expresses a preference for content in French if it exists, otherwise give the default. In general, the header lines exist to give information that is necessary for the request.\nThe HTTP response is different than the request. An example response to this message might be:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nDate: Tue, 09 Aug 2011 15:44:04 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)\nLast-Modified: Tue, 09 Aug 2011 15:11:03 GMT\nContent-Length: 6821\nContent-Type: text/html\n\nThe status line at the top tells us some similar information, like the protocol we are using. The 200 OK is our status code for a good response. There are other status codes:\n\n\n200 OK: request succeeded, information returned.\n\n\n301 Moved Permanently: the address is moved, for example when a website links to its www address; there will be a location header telling the client where the new place is to go\n\n\n400 Bad Request: request is written poorly and could not be understood\n\n\n505 HTTP Version Not Supported: self-explanatory lol\n\n\nThere's tons of valid header lines we can use. The HTTP specification allows for many header lines to be used from various software. Writing a correct HTTP implementation isn't easy.\nCookies\nI mentioned before that HTTP is stateless, which means that the server does not preserve any information about the client after the connection ends. However, websites really want ways to identify users for operations such as logins. In order to facilitate state, websites use cookies. You might have heard of them when you log in to a website and it asks you to accept cookies.\nThe typical creation method of a cookie might look like this:\n\n\nA client makes a request to the server for the first time.\n\n\nThe server generates an identification number for the client.\n\n\nThe server sends a HTTP response to the client with a cookie in the header: Set-cookie: 1678\n\n\nThe client browser stores the cookie in a special file and sends a request to the server with the same cookie number.\n\n\nNow, whenever the client requests the server, it will include a cookie in the header which the server will use.\n\n\nCaching\nYou might have heard of a proxy server before. These servers are usually used by ISPs like your home ISP and your university ISP. These servers contain frequently-accessed data from several origin servers and are located much more closely to the client.\nThese servers are extremely helpful in improving response times for the client as well as reducing traffic for the server. The close location and LAN nature of proxy servers mean that the request/response time between clients and servers are quick. And since the origin server is not accessed as often, its burden of traffic is significantly reduced.\nThe delay in fetching a response from the Internet tends to be dominated by the time for the institutional server receiving a response from the Internet. However, if there is heavy traffic on the access link between the institutional server and the Internet router, that can slow down speeds to minutes per request, which is obviously unacceptable.\n$$ requestRate \\cdot requestSize / speed = trafficIntensity $$\nThe intensity between client and LAN is usually negligible, but the access link between LAN and Internet dominates. With a Web cache, hit rate is generally between 0.2 and 0.7.\n$$ cacheHit \\cdot LANspeed + (1 - cacheHit) \\cdot internetSpeed$$\nThe traffic intensity stops being an issue and Internet delay dominates again once a cache is introduced. It's less expensive and faster than increasing access link speed.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/http/","title":"HTTP Explained"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/ieee-754/":{"body":"IEEE-754 is the standard for floating point computation around the world. Thus, any real-world discussion of floating point must include it.\nFormat\nIEEE-754 floating point numbers are always in base 2 binary; this makes sense as it minimizes wobble which scales with \\(β\\). It also allows for a special optimization that can add an extra bit of precision without increasing the size of the number. To demonstrate that, we can look at the number \\(001010.0011\\). The normalized floating point representation of this is \\(1.0100011 × 2^3\\). Notice how the digit in front of the decimal point is always 1. It can't be 0, because then we could just shift the decimal point and throw away the zero as we did with the initial number. Therefore, IEEE-754 assumes that the first bit is always 1 and only encodes the bits after the decimal point, granting an extra 1. There is an obvious problem with this: the number 0 cannot be represented. In IEEE-754, if the significand and exponent are all 0, then the number is the special case of 0.\nIEEE-754 allows for four possible precisions: single, double, single-extended, and double-extended:\nParameterSingleSingle-ExtendedDoubleDouble-Extended\n\\(p\\)24325364\n\\(e_{max}\\)+127+1023+1023+16383\n\\(e_{min}\\)-126-1022-1022-16382\nbits for exponent8111115\ntotal #&nbsp;of bits32436479\n\nThe usefulness of extended precision is that it grants a large amount of guard digits for internal calculations, for example in a calculator. There are fast algorithms for common transcendental functions like \\(\\log\\), but most of them have a large amount of possible error. By using extended precision internally then rounding to regular precision on display, calculators can quickly compute transcendental functions for users accurately.\nThe exponent value is calculated using a bias so it can represent negative values. The initial unbiased exponent is subtracted by \\(2^{e - 1} - 1\\), e.g. 127 for single precision. The reason that the \\(e_max\\) is always bigger than \\(e_min\\) is to prevent overflow when the reciprocal of the smallest numbers are taken. In turn, the reciprocal of the largest numbers will create underflow. In general, underflow is preferable to overflow, for reasons that will be clear when we discuss overflow in more depth.\nOperations between floating point numbers in IEEE-754 are always exactly rounded. Having a guard digit can reduce error, but it does not guarantee the same result as exact rounding, so it cannot be used. There are methods using two guard digits and a \"sticky\" bit that can be used for efficient exact rounding, however. Exact rounding is important so that the result of two operations can always be guaranteed to be the same, regardless of hardware. The operations defined under IEEE to be exactly rounded are +, -, ×, /, √, %, and conversion with integers. Conversion between binary and decimal is not necessarily exactly rounded, because the most efficient conversion algorithms are not exactly rounded. Transcendental functions are also not specified as exactly rounded because there is no efficient algorithm that works across all hardware.\nNaN and ∞\nIf you've used a calculator before, chances are you have seen both of these terms before. But what do they mean in the context of floating point?\nNot all bit patterns in IEEE-754 follow the rules that were laid out earlier for significands and exponents. Some aren't even valid floating point numbers! There are special values that are possible:\nExponentFractionRepresents\n\\(e = e_{min} - 1\\)f = 0±0\n\\(e = e_{min} - 1\\)f ≠ 0\\(0.f × 2^{e_{min}}\\) (denormalized)\n\\(e_{min} ≤ e ≤ e_{max}\\)—\\(1.f × 2^e\\) (normalized)\n\\(e = e_{max} + 1\\)f = 0±∞\n\\(e = e_{max} + 1\\)f ≠ 0NaN\n\nThe middle row represents normalized numbers, which we are already familiar with. We will discuss each of the other special values.\nAs mentioned earlier, 0 is an exception where the significand and exponent are both 0. But wait, why can 0 be positive and negative? IEEE-754 also defines that \\(+0 = -0\\) so the distinction seems useless. The reason both are allowed is because it preserves the sign of infinity when they interact. It also allows for functions that are only defined for positive or negative numbers to be able to safely include 0 in them.\nDenormalized numbers are numbers with 0 as the hidden bit instead of 1. The reason they need to exist and break these rules is because small numbers being subtracted can end up underflowing to 0. It breaks a common invariant in code that the difference between two unequal numbers is not 0, and can cause bugs. Denormalized numbers gradually underflow to 0 so this problem does not occur. It also significantly reduces relative error for very small numbers.\nThe idea of infinity is an important one to measure for floating point. Unlike with integer arithmetic, division by zero is not an immediate error which aborts the operation. Rather, overflow can be an expected result which is handled for by using infinity. If the infinity ends up in a denominator, then the computation can underflow to 0 which can be an expected result.\nNaN stands for \"Not a Number\" and is perhaps the most unique special valueNaN does not represent any computable value, and it is \"infectious\"; any operation withNaN will result in an NaN and NaNs always compare to false, even with other NaNs. They are a result of computations like \\(0/0\\) or \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) which are not well-defined in real numbers, and also cannot be represented by infinity. These are all the operations that will produce an NaN:\nOperationProduction\n+\\(∞ + (-∞)\\)\n×\\(0 × ∞\\)\n/\\(0/0\\), \\(∞/∞\\)\n%\\(x % 0\\), \\(∞ % y\\)\n√\\(\\sqrt{x}\\) for \\(x &lt; 0\\)\n\nUnlike with denormalized numbers, the value in the significand does not necessarily represent any specific values. Often, some information about the operation will be placed in the significand as a signal. If an operation is done between a real number and an NaN, it will not change the significand of the NaN.\nExceptions\nNaN and ∞ allow floating point calculations to continue in the face of special circumstances without aborting immediately. However, this behavior is not always appropriate. Implementations of IEEE-754 typically have trap handlers that will handle exceptions generated by such circumstances. There are five classes of exception that can each be set by a status flag: overflow, underflow, division by zero, invalid operations, and inexact operations. Invalid operations are any that involve NaN except for those when one of the operands are already NaN.\nOperations in IEEE-754 must be exact, so if an operation is performed that is inexact, it will raise an exception. However, this raises an issue. Inexact exceptions can happen extremely often, and telling the OS to summon the trap handler every time harms performance. In order to prevent this, a software flag is typically enabled upon inexact exception to mask off future exceptions until the flag is reset.\nAlthough trap handlers can abort the algorithm, they can also exhibit other behavior which can aid algorithms in being more efficient and accurate. For example, IEEE-754 will wrap around overflowing numbers by dividing the computed result by \\(2^α\\). \\(α\\) is 192 for single precision and 1536 for double precision. This is useful in partial products when the operation might overflow and underflow at several points. By allowing the products to continue without aborting, the final product might cancel out under/overflows and be in range without having to stop the OS at every point.\nRounding\nWe stated earlier that round to even is the best and most commonly accepted method of rounding. This is the default mode of IEEE-754. However, there are other acceptable rounding modes that can be enabled for certain operations. These are round to 0, to +∞, and to -∞. These modes turn rounding into floor/ceiling operations, which are useful for computing intervals.\nWe can represent floating point results as an interval between two numbers where the first is rounded to -∞ and the second is rounded to +∞. The exact result is somewhere between those two numbers. This representation can be useful to get an idea of how wide your error is when calculating a result. If the result with single precision has a very wide interval, then you might redo the result in double precision and so on to shrink the interval to some acceptable level of error.\nAll this information comes from the landmark paper&nbsp;What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/ieee-754/","title":"IEEE-754"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/induction/":{"body":"The final piece to the puzzle of electromagnetism here is electromagnetic induction, where we use magnets to create current.\nInduced Emf/Current\nLike with charges in a magnetic field, magnets do not generate current unless they are moving relative to a wire. The changing magnetic field \\(\\vec{B}\\) is what creates the current. This current is called an induced current, and the \"emf\" that causes it which is the wire itself is an induced emf.\nThe emf can also be induced by changing the area of coil in a magnetic field, as that changes the relationship between the magnetic field and coil.\nThese examples are in a closed circuit, which has a current. An open circuit would not have a current, but it would still have the induced emf.\nMotional Emf\nAn induced emf is created in a metal rod that moves through a magnetic field as long as the velocity is not parallel to the magnetic field. We can use RHR1 to determine where the positive and negative sides of the rod are when the rod has a velocity through a magnetic field. The movement of these charges to either end of the rod cause a charge separation to occur, which leads to a current running from the negative end to the positive end. This is called motional emf because it comes from the motion through a magnetic field.\nWe can find the motional emf when the length, velocity, and magnetic field are all perpendicular i.e. they all have their own axis:\n$$Ε = vBL$$\nThere is another magnetic force that opposes the motional emf. The current creates its own magnetic field, which by RHR1 would actually oppose the velocity of a mutually perpendicular system. We have to have an external force moving the rod otherwise the magnetic field produced by its own current will cause it to stop.\nMagnetic Flux\nRemember electric flux? Magnetic flux is quite similar in that it is defined as amount of magnetic field passing through an area, so \\(Φ = BA\\cos{θ}\\) in \\(Wb\\) or \\(T \\cdot m^2\\). We can define motional emf through magnetic flux like so:\n$$Ε = -\\frac{ΔΦ}{Δt}$$\nor, emf is the rate of change of magnetic flux. This is why we can induce an emf by changing the area of a coil. The reason that the equation is negative is because the induced current will create a magnetic force which will oppose its velocity direction.\nFaraday's Law\nFaraday's Law is precisely the equation we just laid out but with one additional component to account for loops:\n$$Ε = -N\\frac{ΔΦ}{Δt}$$\nThe emf is generated if the flux changes, which depends on \\(B\\), \\(A\\), or \\(ɸ\\), which are magnetic field, area, and angle of the magnetic field with respect to the normal of the surface.\nLenz's Law\nLenz's Law is less of an equation and more of a method to understand the polarity of an induced emf. Let's follow the reasoning:\n\n\nCheck whether the flux is increasing or decreasing.\n\n\nFind the direction of the induced magnetic field to oppose the change in flux.\n\n\nUse RHR2 with the previous step to find the positive and negative end, with the polarity coming out of your palm.\n\n\nThis is best understood through an example. Let's imagine we have a loop with a bar magnet approaching at north side head on.\n\n\nThe flux is increasing, because the magnet is getting closer.\n\n\nThe induced magnetic field must oppose the magnet field to decrease the flux.\n\n\nRHR2 tells us that if the magnetic field is coming out of our palm at the magnet, the current must be going counter-clockwise. Therefore, the left point is positive and the right is negative, as the external circuit must have positive going to negative.\n\n\nTransformers\nA transformer is a device that increases or decreases ac voltage. It is responsible for reducing the voltage in your phone charge so you're not sending 120 V to your phone that doesn't need it. This change is called a step-up or step-down which increases or decreases the voltage, respectively, directly.\nWhen we send power over power lines, there is a certain power loss that happens depending on the voltage and the resistance of the transmitting power wire:\n$$P_{lost} = I^2R$$\nwhich we subtract from our initial power to get the final power.\nIf we want to figure out how much voltage we need to step-up or step-down to get a specific power loss, we just resubstitute the desired power loss into that equation to get the current and proportion it to the voltage.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/induction/","title":"Electromagnetic Induction"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/isp-addressing/":{"body":"How does an ISP assign IP addresses to its customers?\n\nAn ISP has a block of addresses that are partitioned to its customers.

For example, if our network is 128.64.32/24, a range we could have is 128.64.32.0-127 and 128-255. The easiest way to mask this is to look at the most significant bit. In the first range, the most significant bit is 0, and in the second range, the most significant bit is 1. The mask in this case would be 255.255.255.128 or in hex, F.F.F.8. If we bitwise AND this mask with the IP address, we will get the correct subnet.\nWe can follow the same procedure to get further divisions by the power of 2. We can mask over two bits to get four subnets of ranges 0-63, 64-127, 128-191, and 192-255 with a mask of 255.255.255.192.\nLet's think of an analogy. If we want to deliver some mail to our neighbor, the easiest way to do it is to go directly to his mailbox and give it to him instead of passing it off to the post office. In the same way, we can quickly send messages between hosts on the same subnet.\nIn order to facilitate this, the router will first check if the sender and destination (both first &amp;ed with the subnet mask) are in the same subnet. If they are, it doesn't bother sending the message over the Internet and it will actually just directly send the message to the destination itself.\nIn particular, this makes email between people on the same networks extremely quick. This is why it's nice to have email between people with the scarletmail.rutgers.edu domain.\nIPv4 Header\nIn order to get a packet to a destination host, we need a packet header with the identity of both the destination identity and the source identity. At this layer, we don't worry about reliable exchange, dropping packets, sequence numbers, etc. That's for TCP to handle, our only job is to send the packet to the destination.\nHowever, we have to detect some kinds of problems. We don't want to loop packets over and over, this will overload the network. There used to be a worry of fragmentation, if the size of the packet is greater than the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the router. Nowadays, everyone has broadband so this is not an issue because everybody has high link speeds. When IPv4 was invented we needed checksums for verification if there are bit flips. IPv6 addresses have much less checksum machinery because it's a waste nowadays, it only checks at the end. IPv4 has to calculate a checksum at every router, which catches errors early but is generally wasteful.\nThe time to live (TTL) is 1 byte long and is used to protect against loops. It starts at 255 and decrements every time it passes through a router. If the TTL is 0,  the packet is dropped and a \"time exceeded\" error is thrown to sender. This prevents the packet from being looped around forever.\nAn entire 4 bytes is devoted to fragmentation machinery. This is not in IPv6, which simply throw an error if the packet is too large. The reason this is fine because it is a rare case nowadays and it cuts fat out of the header. Here are the steps of fragmentation:\n\n\nrouter receives packet larger than MTU\n\n\nif Don't Fragment (DF) flag is set, throw Fragmentation Needed error\n\n\nelse, divide the packet into fragments maximum size outgoing MTU - header size (20 bytes)\n\n\nin each new packet fragment, the length field is the size of the fragment, the More Fragments (MF) flag is set except for the last fragment, and the fragment offset field is set to the offset of the fragment in 8-byte blocks. The checksum is recomputed for the fragment. IPv4 - Wikipedia\n\n\nICMP\nWhat do we do to propagate errors? We're already using IP for sending messages, how do we send errors? This what the ICMP protcol is for. It is unreliable like UDP, and is tightly coupled with the implementation of IP. Its protcol ID is 1, which signifies its importance.\nThere are certain known error codes. The echo request/reply also known as ping is simply a request to check if the host is alive and responding. There is also the traceroute, which records the route that a packet takes by tracking TTL. As we know, when a router receives a packet, it decrements TTL. If we start TTL at 0 and slowly increase it, it will throw time exceeded back to us from each router in order. This way, we can see every router on the way to our destination.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/isp-addressing/","title":"ISP Addressing"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/lambda-calculus/":{"body":"When we discuss the principles of programming languages, lambda calculus is the bedrock of our discussion. It is the most abstract, formal way to describe functions and application.\nTuring Completeness\nA programming language is said to be Turing complete if it can compute any function also computable on a Turing machine. It must either be able to emulate a Turing machine, or it must be able to emulate a Turing complete language.\nAlthough this is a powerful definition, in truth it is a simple one to satisfy. Features like loops and currying are not related to Turing completeness.\nSyntax\nLambda calculus is a very simple language which only uses functions and applications, but is still Turing complete.\nAn expression in lambda calculus is defined as\ne ::= x    # variable\n    | λx.e # abstraction (function definition)\n    | e e  # application (function call)\n\nEverything is a function in lambda calculus. We can make a simple interpreter in OCaml as with Imp:\ntype exp =\n    | Var of string\n    | Lam of string * exp\n    | App of exp * exp\n\nin the same order that was defined earlier. Lam here is similar to Fun for Imp. The lambda calculus expression\n(λx.λy.x y) λx.x x\n\ncan be deconstructed to its AST as\nApp(\n    Lam(\"x\",\n        Lam(\"y\",\n            App(Var \"x\", Var \"y\")\n        )\n    ),\n    Lam(\"x\",\n        App(Var \"x\", Var \"y\")\n    )\n)\n\nLet's parse this out forwards. First we read that there is a parenthesis, which means that there is an expression enclosed within. There is a \\(λ\\), which means that the expression is a lambda. The next letter is x, which is the name of the Lam. The period following separates the function definition to the containing expression, which continues to another \\(λ\\). That means that the containing expression is also a Lam, which is called \"y\". The containing expression is now an App which is composed of two Vars. This is the end of the nesting because we hit the end parenthesis. The same logic applies for the second expression but with less nesting. Since we have two expressions at the top-level, the full expression is an App.\nThe scope of \\(λ\\) extends as far to the right as possible, excepting parentheses. This is why we needed the parentheses for the first term in the above statement, otherwise the first \\(λ\\) would extend throughout the entire statement. The application, however, is left-associative, like OCaml. \nBeta Reduction\nA function call of type (λx.e1) e2 replaces all instances of x in e1 with e2. That means that we can substitute this statement with e1{e2/x}. This is called beta reduction. All we have done is apply the function and replace the formal parameters through substitutions. Beta reductions should always be idempotent for the statement. When no more beta reductions can be performed on a term, then it is said to be in beta normal form, for example λx.e.\nAnother example will be instructive here. Take the term (λx.λz.x z) y. This is a function application, since it has two terms. It follows the form that we stated earlier, so we can substitute all instances of y on the outside \\(λ\\). This would give us the final term λz.(y z) eliminating the outside λx and replacing the x in the inner term with y.\nAlpha Conversion\nLambda calculus is statically scoped which means that variable definitions are only scoped locally. That means that within a function, you can rename bound variables with the same meaning. This is called alpha conversion.\nAn important distinction here is between a free and bound variable. Free variables are not contained within a lambda, while bound variables are. For example, in (λy.λz.y z x), y and z are bound to λz and λy, respectively, while x is free. λy contains the App of λz and z.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/lambda-calculus/","title":"Lambda Calculus"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/lets-tuples-records/":{"body":"Lists are the most basic data structure in OCaml, but there are others that we need to be aware of.\nLet Expressions\nWe have seen the keyword let used to define expressions and store values. However, the same keyword can be used to create expressions which bind variables in other expressions. The let statements we used before do not evaluate to any value, while let expressions do evaluate.\nlet x = 5 in x * 3\n\nThe in keyword gives us a clue on what's going on. You can think of it almost like a function where we replace variables in the inner expression with the values in the outer expression. The expression above evaluates to 15, because it is x * 3 in which x is 5.\nWe can type check this expression where x has the same type of the binding expression.\nIf you omit in, you can think of that as a let expression which is bound in the global scope instead of the scope of the body expression.\nlet x = 37;;\n\nIn this statement x is defined as 37 in the global scope and it can be used elsewhere.\nI've used the word scope a lot here, so let's define that a little more concretely. In the above let expression, the variable x is not visible in any other part of the program. Let's imagine that we have both of these lines together, the let expression and the let statement. They're both named x, so what would the value be?\nWe can imagine evaluating expressions right to left, and upon encountering a variable, act like it is a pointer to an expression in the outer scope. In the innermost scope, the expression is x * 3. This expression has no meaning because x is a variable, so we back up one scope and check if x is defined. And in fact, it is! So we will replace the x in that expression with 5. Note that even though x is defined as 37 in the global scope, the inner scope shadows the global scope.\nShadowing refers to when a variable name is rebound in an inner scope to have a different meaning. Some languages, such as Java, do not allow you to do this because of possible confusion. However, it is sometimes useful to use the same name for different things, so languages like C and OCaml permit shadowing.\nYou can also use let expressions inside a function, and this is often good style because it clarifies constants:\nlet area d =\n    let pi = 3.14 in\n    let r = d /. 2.0 in\n    pi *. r *. r\n\nMuch better than C #define, right?\nOCaml does not permit you to mutate variables. However, you can simulate this by shadowing a variable with a new value:\nlet x = 0;;\nx = x + 1;; (* not allowed! *)\nlet x = x + 1; (* allowed, but discouraged *)\n\nThis is kind of an ugly hack so you should avoid it in real code, though it is technically possible under OCaml's rules.\nWe can nest let expressions, but this is generally bad practice like shadowing. Realistically, it's usually better to just write linear expressions.\nlet expressions don't just have to use a plain variable. We can also use patterns to bind expressions, and if the binding expressions fails to match the pattern then we have an exception. This is useful when we want to extract a particular value from an expression.\nlet [x] = [1] in 1 :: x (*  evaluates to [1; 1*)\n\nTuples\nTuples represent collections, like lists, but they contain a fixed amount of values. The tradeoff is that they can be heterogenous, which means they can have multiple types. The type of a tuple is the type of each of its component, separated by asterisks.\n(1, 2) (* int * int *)\n(1, \"string\", 3.5) (* int * string * float *)\n\nBecause each tuple has a distinct type, a list of tuples can only have one type of tuples in it.\nTuples lend themselves particularly well to pattern matching. Instead of having multiple function arguments like is typical in OCaml, we can have one argument that is a tuple and then pattern match it in order to destructure it. This is also a convenient way to return multiple variables from a function, which is otherwise not allowed.\nRecords\nEach element of a tuple is referenced by its position. Sometimes, we want to reference elements by name, like in a dictionary. For this use, we use records. Records are a distinct type that must be pre-defined before being used.\ntype date = { month: string; day: int; year: int }\n\nNow, we can construct records by using the same brace notation but giving each name a value.\nlet today = { day=3; year=2022; month=\"f\"^\"eb\" };;\n\nYou might notice that this has a similar syntax to C-style structs. The fields can be accessed through . syntax as in today.day, and the order of the struct assignment doesn't matter.\nRecords can also be conveniently destructured, like all other data structures. \n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/lets-tuples-records/","title":"Lets, Tuples, and Records in OCaml"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/link-layer/":{"body":"Through all the layers of the internet, the most essential is the link layer: converting bits to and from signals, detecting errors, flow control, and addressing.\nEncoding\nWe have spoken mostly through the guise of bits per second being sent across the internet and have left it at that. But what does it mean to send a bit over air waves? This isn't like a traditional electrical circuit or transistor in your computer; the internet uses signals.\nThe nuances of digital signal processing are beyond these notes, so we will simplify here. We can imagine signals like a pseudo-transistor where low signals are 0 and high signals are 1. However, this causes two issues. One is that time synchronization is impossible for waves that travel at the speed of light, and the other is that because signals are not emitting all the time, we need a way to differentiate between signals and simple noise.\nThe time synchronization is mandated by a clock standard such as the Manchester encoding, which is slower than the speed of light but allows each link to know exactly when a signal is coming.\nFraming\nA frame is a group of bits in sequence. Frames are useful for manipulating data at the link layer, but they can escalate small bit errors to big problems. If a frame is too big, then it will error out too often, so we will often have smaller frames.\nWe also need a way to delineate the beginning and ending of frames. There are two ways, character stuffing and bit stuffing.\nWith character stuffing, a special meta character will be used to delineate frames. ^ is used for the beginning of frame (BOF) and $ is used for EOF. If you need a $ in your text, then simply add an escape character, like another $ right beforehand.\nWith bit stuffing, a unique bit sequence 0x7E or 0b01111110 will delineate frames. If that sequence appears in the data, it will insert a 0 within like 0b011111010.\nError Control\nInevitably, bits will be corrupted on a physical link. This is a reality of circuit engineering. We have discussed several ways to handle errors on the application and protocol layer; what about on the link layer? We can either request retransmission as with TCP, or we can make corrections to the errors automatically, which may or may not be possible.\nParity bits can ensure a fixed sequence so that the extra bit can protect against errors. For example, with even parity, there will always be an even number of 1s, so if a bit flip changes that, you know that there was an error. But multiple bit errors can escape this detection.\nAnother method is when the sender will send a checksum computed from the message divided into chunks along with the message so that the receiver can use the checksum, just like with other layers.\nPolynomial codes utilize the high degree of uncertainty when computing mod of a polynomial. The remainder must be added to the message and it can be checked by the receiver. This is a more complex form of error detection mathematically.\nAddressing\nWe have heretofore defined a host as an IP address. But how do we identifies hosts at the link layer? For links we use a MAC address, which is a unique 48 bit address to a device which will communicate through the internet. MAC addresses are far less sophisticated than IP addresses. They cannot be grouped or categorized like with NAT. The MAC address of the destination is included in the frame that is sent. They are also unique to types of links, so a device will have different MAC addresses for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.\nHosts can then interact in multiple ways. One way is access point. Hosts must communicate with an access point which acts as an intermediary between hosts. Another is ad hoc. When you set up your Amazon Echo for the first time, you connect with it ad hoc via Bluetooth on your app and set it up from there to program it. \nARP\nWhen connecting via LAN, hosts are part of the same subnet. In order to translate the IP address to a MAC address, the hosts use a protocol called ARP (Address Resolution Protocol. This is a simple protocol which defines its own identification and a source/destination address, as well as a broadcast FF packet. We know the sender IP, MAC, and the destination IP, but we don't know the destination MAC address, so that field is blank. The ARP packet will traverse the entire link, and if a host recognizes its own IP address, then it will send an ARP reply back to the source with its MAC address.\nLAN Extension\nLANs seem pretty nice. Why don't we just use LANs everywhere? Bandwidth is limited, so you need to limit the amount of hosts that can connect on one network.\nA learning bridge is a type of access point that connects LAN segments. It maintains a table of hosts that are connected to the network. It intermediates between the hosts, receiving and sending packets as necessary if packets are sent between LANs. For each packet, the bridge stores the MAC and port of the packet and then floods all the LANs if it can't find a match.\nMultiple Access\nIf two packets are sent at the same time, that is called collision or interference. We can only have one pair communicating at a time. We must have a multiple access protocol to make sure that only one access method is used at a time. You can think of being in a class; if everyone spoke at once, it would be mayhem! There must be an extra overhead of each person raising their hand in order to ensure correct communication takes place.\nWireless\nWhen a host sends a wireless signal that bounces off of a satellite to a receiver, how do we know that interference has occurred? We could use a TCP packet timeout, but that takes a while. A neat trick that you can do is leverage the fact that satellites reflect all signals to everyone, including your own. A host can receive its own signal and check if it was interfered with.\nOriginally, pure ALOHA was used, based on the needs of a university in Hawaii. This uses the broadcast method. If it receives garbage back, it will sleep for a random amount of time and retransmit. The reason it is random is because if both the hosts that sent garbage data send the packets again at the same time, it will cause another collision! For transmission time \\(t\\), the vulnerable period where packets will be destroyed is \\(2t\\).\nSlotted ALOHA has better checks to stop collisions from occurring in the first place by setting slots where hosts will send packets, which means that they wouldn't collide in different slots.\nBut the best throughput is done if we check the actual channel before transmitting the packet, so we don't have to guess or check after the fact if a collision happened. For this we need CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access). If the channel is sensed and there are packets travelling, the host will wait to send the packet then immediately send a packet when free. This is a persistent system. The problem with this is that this will cause a collision when multiple hosts are waiting for a channel. We can solve this the way we solved ALOHA. If each host sleeps a random amount of time, even a small amount of time, it will give the hosts time to sense the channel.\nContention Access Methods\nIn order to sense the channel, there are many methods.\n1-Persistent CSMA will constantly bug the channel to check if the channel is idle. If it's busy, transmit and check again. This only really works when there is one host trying to connect.\nNon-Persistent CSMA will transmit, then sleep for a random amount of time before trying again if the channel is busy. This means that that collisions won't happen. This is better than the previous method, but can be slow.\n\\(P\\)-Persistent CSMA has the same idea, but instead of being random it will transmit again with probability \\(P\\). This fine-tunes the previous method for our specific needs and improves utilization.\nEthernet uses the Ethernet Backoff Algorithm, which utilizes binary exponential backoff. If a collision happens, then it will pick a time slot to transmit again out of \\(2^k\\) slots, where \\(k\\) is the number of collisions that have occurred. The length of each time slot is equivalent to. For example, let's say two hosts collide on an Ethernet connection. Both hosts will both, on their own, divide the next few seconds into two slots and randomly pick between them. If they each end up in different slots, they'll transmit fine. If they end up in the same slot again, repeat the process but with four slots. As you can see, the chance of collision will dramatically decrease with more slots. After a maximum of sixteen slots, if there are still collisions, then your host will give up and say that the link is down.\nEthernet\nEthernet is a wired multiple access protocol defined by IEEE 802.3. As previously stated, it uses 1-persistent CSMA with the backoff algorithm.\nEthernet frames have a preamble full of special information, as well as the source/destination MAC addresses already mentioned. The header will also say the type of protocol being used, whether it is IPv4, IPv6, ARP, RARP, etc. Finally, at the end, a checksum will be stored so that we can check if corruption has occurred.\nPreambleSource MACDest. MACTypeDataChecksum\n\nMultiple Access Channel Partitioning\nWe have previously assumed that all hosts are fighting for the use of one channel and will have to retry connections if collisions occur. One way to solve this is to have predetermined allocation of channel access. This way, there is no chance of collision because each user will wait its turn on its own. However, this can introduce wastage if users are assigned to a channel partition but end up being idle. The division is governed by different techniques.\nTDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) will divide the spectrum across time. Like how OS schedulers will give processes exclusive access to the CPU for a certain amount of time, so too will users be granted exclusive access to the channel for a certain amount of time.\nFDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) will divide the spectrum across frequencies. The most common example of this is for radio. Radio channels are exclusive to certain frequencies.\nCDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) will send signals in a coded format. Imagine a large group of people that are speaking all at the same time. If everyone is speaking in English, the message will quickly get garbled. However, if every conversation has its own language, then the message will be clear. Even if I hear a conversation next to me in Chinese, I will tune it out because I don't know Chinese and be able to speak and hear in English. There must be some amount of power control so that one person does not speak too loud, but otherwise the communication will work.\nLAN\nComputers can be connected through a sort of wireless LAN. If connecting a computer that does not have a screen or an otherwise easily accessible user interface, it is often convenient to connect with it using ad-hoc mode to a device with a screen so it can be configured, like Amazon Echo.\nEach local set of computers that can connect in these ways is known as a BSS (Basic Service Set). This is known commonly as a LAN. The sender will wait for the sense channel to be idle than transmit the entire frame, else do a random timeout multiplying by 2 as with Ethernet, and the access point will return an ACK.\nAccess control in this sense is mediated by the time waited to check if the channel is busy or not. However, this can still cause collisions if a router does not hear from another, which is the hidden terminal problem. An exposed terminal problem may occur when a terminal is not properly signaled to not send because it is busy.\nIn order to mediate these issues, senders send a small packet called RTS (request to send) and a receiver will send a small packet called CTS (clear to send). If senders hear an RTS from somewhere else, they'll wait until the receiver is clear to send to. If there isn't a CTS, they can transmit because the receiver is open in that time. In this context, the HTP and ETP are caused when neither RTS nor CTS are heard, or when RTS is heard but not CTS.\nTo avoid these issues, we can reserve channels in the same way that channels are reserved in CSMA. The small reservation packets are unlikely to collide compared to the large frame packets.\nBluetooth\nBluetooth is a short-range kind of Wi-Fi technology that operates in the ISM band of 2.4GHz to 2.8 GHz. It was initially created for use by wireless mice and keyboards. The data rate goes up to 721 Kbps, which is fine because it's not intended for data transfer, just communicating with nearby wireless devices.\nIn order to code this message, frequency hopping will be used. A frequency sequence will be sent via CDMA about which frequencies will be used to transmit data in sequence. Then, the sender will send the sequence in parts at each frequency in order. The receiver which knows the frequency sequence will be able to tune into the right frequencies at the right time and receive the correct bitstream. Anyone else listening to the bitstream that doesn't know the frequency sequence won't understand it.\nPersonal area networks under Bluetooth are either Piconet or Scatternet. Piconet has master/slave nodes, where the master is the one that allocates the Bluetooth channels among the slaves. Scatternet allows devices to be either master or slave in different networks so that a device can act differently in Bluetooth in different settings.\nConnection is established by beginning with an inquiry broadcast by the Bluetooth device. A potential slave will respond and the master will send back a page for the hopping sequence. The other device will establish itself as a slave through a slave response and the master device will do likewise, at which time the connection is established through ACK-DAC.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/link-layer/","title":"The Link Layer"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/lists/":{"body":"Lists are the most basic data structure in OCaml. The most analoguous structure is a vector in C++ or Rust. Lists are homogenous and of arbitrary length.\n\nThe most basic list is nil, the empty list: []. We can prepend elements to a list through the cons operator: ::. Every display of a list is actually just syntactic sugar for every element being cons with the empty list:\n[1, 2, 3] = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: []\n\nImportantly, lists are immutable! When they are created, they cannot be changed. If you want to add an element to a list, you must construct a new list based on the old one.\n\nThis might seem inefficient, to create a new list every time we want to change it. But the semantics of a language do not necessarily correspond to its compiled execution. In particular, the invariant that lists are immutable can lead to optimizations where a compiler doesn't need to keep track of mutated information.\n\nIt is convention to call the right hand side the tail and the left hand side the head. The cons operator has an element on the left side and an list on the right side.\nLet's think of lists in terms of expressions. [] is a value like 0 or 1. The cons operator evaluates the left expression to an element and the right expression to a list of type element. Like with function arguments, the order of this evaluation is irrelevant as long as we don't introduce side effects.\nLists can also have the polymorphic type 'a. This is similar to a generic type in languages like Java, C++, and Rust. An 'a list can have any type. This is most useful when it comes to function types. If the function type accepts or returns a 'a type, then it is a generic function that can be used on a list of any type. Nil is a 'a list.\nYou can also have nested lists like this:\nlet m = [[1]; [2; 3]] ;; (* int list list *)\n\nUnlike tuples, these lists do not have to be the same size. They do need to have the same type, however, so this is a list of int lists, or an int list list.\nThe cons operator does not work to concatenate two lists. It can only add one element to an existing list. This is a very common bug (at least for myself). OCaml has a special sugar operand @ to concatenate lists, although it is technically an ordinary function.\nPattern Matching\nPattern matching is an extremely important concept in OCaml for functional programming. It allows for powerful destructuring of enums, collections, and other complex objects.\nlet head l =\n    match l with\n    | (h :: _) -&gt; h\n\nThis function head here matches the list l where there is an element h that is cons with an arbitrary expression. The _ indicates that some expression must be present, but we don't care about what expression it is, and in fact we are throwing it away. h is also an arbitrary expression, but we are using it as the return type.\nThis match statement is not exhaustive. An exhaustive match means that there is an evaluation for every possible case of l. Here, there is no case for when l is nil. This does not work in OCaml; every match must be exhaustive. Here is an example of an exhaustive match:\nlet rec sum l =\n    match l with\n    | [] -&gt; 0\n    | h :: t -&gt; h + sum t\n\nThis sum function works for every case of l. Either it is nil, or it is a head cons a tail. You will also notice here that the two cases resolve to the same type. This is another requirement for match statements: all patterns must evaluate to the same type, which is not necessarily the type of the initial expression. Here, the initial expression has the type int list and the return expression has the type int. This function only works for int list. This restriction is not present for our head function because h is polymorphic type 'a.\nPattern matching is generally much better than its alternatives. OCaml will warn you if your function is non-exhaustive, and it will throw an exception for an unhandled case. Also, duplicated cases are easy to avoid becaues OCaml will give a similar warning for unused cases.\nRecursion with Lists\nIn order to manipulate lists in any significant way, we need to use recursion. Lists are immutable, so functions over them must be recursive.\nlet rec length l =\n    match l with\n    | [] -&gt; 0\n    | (_ :: t) -&gt; 1 + length t\n\nWe can think of this as recursive because we have our base case of nil and our iterative step of applying the function to successive tails. This function does not use h, but we might, as in the sum function above. Recursion might seem like it incurs overhead here, as in C-like languages recursion typically costs stack frames. However, OCaml knows that even though you are writing your code recursively, all you're doing is iterating over an immutable list, so it will elide those issues. Such recursive functions are called tail-recursive and are essential to the use of functional languages.\nHowever, these functions work through the lists forward, like a linked list. How can we do something like reversing a list?\nlet rec rev_aux l acc =\n    match l with\n    | [] -&gt; acc\n    | x :: xs -&gt; rev_aux xs (x :: acc)\nlet rev l = rev_aux l []\n\nThe key here is the variable acc, which is known as an accumulator. This is a variable that is included with each recursive function call that accumulates operations on it. This is a way of simulating side effects in a controlled way which is often useful. acc will accumulate heads while the tail grows smaller, and the actual rev function will get the accumulated nil that it passed to rev_aux.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/lists/","title":"Lists in OCaml"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/magnets/":{"body":"The question of how magnets work has long puzzled many. We will endeavor to answer all of those questions today.\nMagnetic Fields\nMagnets work similarly to electric charges where like poles repel, and unlike poles attract. However, magnets do not ever exist in isolation. Every magnet has a north and south pole, while you can have an isolated positive or negative charge.\nEvery magnet has a magnetic field around it, similar to the electric field around electric charges. The direction of the magnetic field is shown by the north pole. Every magnetic field points from south to north; this is why compasses point north. They are based off of the magnetic field of the polarity of the Earth's own magnetic field.\nYou can apply many of the concepts of electric fields to magnetic fields, such as field lines and the way they curve and indicate field direction.\nMagnetic Force\nCharges experience electric force in a field, and they experience magnetic force in a magnetic field. However, a few conditions must be met:\n\n\nThe charge must be moving.\n\n\nThe velocity of the charge must have a component perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field.\n\n\nTo visualize the second rule, imagine the magnetic force like a buffeting wind around the charge. The wind only has any force if it has something to push on. If you hold a piece of paper parallel to the direction to the wind, it'll barely move because there's nothing to push.\n\nThis is such an important point it's in its own section. Right Hand Rule No. 1 (RHR1) will tell us the direction of a magnetic force based on the magnetic field and velocity of charge. Your right thumb points in the direction of the charge, and the fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field. The palm faces in the direction of the magnetic force.\nThis is only applies to positive charges. Negative charges will have the direction of the force as opposite.\n\nThe magnitude \\(B\\) of a magnetic field is defined in teslas \\(T\\) by\n$$B = \\frac{F}{|q_0|(v \\sin{θ})}$$\nwhere \\(F\\) is the magnitude of the magnetic force on test charge \\(q_0\\) with velocity \\(v\\).\nMotion\nWe have been comparing electric fields and magnetic fields a lot, but in regards to motion through them they are quite different. Electric fields attract towards its directions, while magnetic fields direct in the other perpendicular direction. If left to its devices, a moving charge would perpetually move in a circle remaining perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nThis means that the work done by a magnetic field is also different. In fact, the magnetic force cannot do work, it can only change the direction of the particle, not its speed nor its energy.\nThe force required to keep a charge moving in a circle is:\n$$F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r} or\\ r = \\frac{mv}{|q|B}$$\nCurrents in a Magnetic Field\nWe've discussed charges moving through a magnetic field; what about a current? A current is just a collection of moving charges, after all. If we have a wire with a current running through it placed between two magnets, then we can consider the direction of the current as the charge direction in RHR1 to calculate the direction of the magnetic force.\nWe can use a bit of a trick to get the calculation of magnetic force for a current. We can rearrange the earlier equation for a magnetic field to get the equation for force. Current is the same thing as charge over time, so \\(\\frac{Δq}{Δt}\\). Length of the current is the same thing as velocity multiplied by time \\((\\frac{m}{s} \\cdot s)\\). If we multiply these, the \\(Δt\\) will cancel out and we will be left with the same expression as \\(|q_0|v\\)! Our new equation for force is:\n$$F = ILB \\sin{θ}$$\nThe angle \\(θ\\) here maximizes current when perpendicular and is zero when parallel, just as with a single charge.\nTorque\nAs a refresher, torque describes the rate of change of the angular momentum of an object. Current-carrying wires have magnetic force applied to them which causes them to move. If the wire are in a loop, then the magnetic force is applied as torque which causes the loop to rotate. Its resting state is when the normal of the loop is aligned with the magnetic field. You can think of it like a compass needle, which will turn until it reaches its resting state of pointing towards the north pole.\nTo calculate the torque, we get the force of each side of the loop turning, which is half the width and so half the force. Summed together we get:\n$$τ = NIAB \\sin{θ}$$\n\\(N\\) here is the number of loops in the wire and \\(A\\) is the area that the loops make. When the loop is parallel with the magnetic field it experiences the greatest torque, and when it is perpendicular it experiences none.\nThe collective expression \\(NIA\\) is known as the magnetic moment of the coil in \\(A \\cdot m^2\\).\nMotors operate using this principle of a coil turning in a magnetic field.\nMagnetic Fields in a Current\nCurrent-carrying wires create their own kinds of magnetic fields.\n\nThe second Right-Hand Rule (RHR2) is easier to remember, as it's just a thumbs-up. The thumb points towards the direction of the current, and the fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field generated.\n\nThe magnetic field magnitude is given by the following equation:\n$$B = \\frac{μ_0I}{2πr}$$\nwith \\(μ_0\\) representing the permeability of free space with the value \\(μ_0 = 4π × 10^{-7} T \\cdot m/A\\).  This equation is for an infinitely long, straight wire, which is not necessarily the case.\nBecause of this property, currents can affect each other magnetically. Currents in the same direction are attrated to each other.\nCurrents in a loop have a slightly different magnetic field equation to the straight wire:\n$$B = N\\frac{μ_0I}{2R}$$\nin the center of the loop, where the field is strongest.\nA useful visual for the magnetic field of a current loop is a bar magnet placed in the middle of the loop. If we use RHR2 here, the north pole is on the palm and the south pole is on the back of the hand.\nAmpère's Law\nFor any current geometry that produces a magnetic field that does not change in time,\n$$ΣB_{||}Δl = μ_0I$$\nwhere \\(Δl\\) is a small segment of length along a closed path of arbitrary shape around the current, \\(B_{||}\\) is the component of the magnetic field parallel to \\(Δl\\), \\(I\\) i sthe net current passing through the surface bounded by the path, and the \\(μ_0\\) is the permeability of free space. The symbol \\(Σ\\) indicates the sum of all \\(B_{||}Δl\\) terms must be taken around the closed path.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/magnets/","title":"Magnets"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/making-a-website/":{"body":"Making a website in the modern era is not easy to do for free. I did it using Zola, Github Pages, and Github Actions.\n\nI've always wanted to have a personal website where I can upload what I do on my local computer to access remotely and have the world see. But it always seemed like too much of a hassle to set up and I didn't have the capital to invest in a website that I didn't need. However, when I started going back to university in-person this year, I found it much easier to take notes by typing them instead of using OneNote as I was accustomed, as the amount of code I had to write was drastically increased. Needing a way to access them remotely with a nice view, I thought a blog would be a good way to do that in addition to all the other things I had always wanted a website for. So, I embarked on a journey to create a website.\nGithub Pages\nA website is no use unless we have somewhere to put it. Github Pages is a service offered by Github since 2008 that allows you to host your own website from a Github repository. You get one free website per Github account, which is called [username].github.io. All we have to do to enable it is create a repository named [username].github.io and enable Github Pages in the settings!\n# should be above 2.28 to enable default branch name change\ngit --version\n\nmkdir [username].github.io\ncd [username].github.io\n\n# personal git config\ngit config --global user.name \"NAME\"\ngit config --global user.email \"EMAIL\"\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch \"main\"\ngit init\n\ngh repo create [username].github.io --public --source=. --remote-upstream\n\nIf you're using Visual Studio Code as your editor, there's a nicer way to do this than through the command line. After installing the Github extension, go to the Source Control button on the sidebar. There should be a button labeled \"Publish to Github\" which allows you to interactively initialize a Git repository in the current folder and publish it to Github.\nGithub Actions\nWe might have created our Github page, but we need a way to get all of the code from our repository to the website. This is called deployment. Luckily, we have a way to automatically deploy our website through Github Actions. Github Actions is another service offered by Github since 2019 that gives you free CI in public repositories. Although the free tier is fairly limited at 500 MB and 2000 minutes per month, it should be more than enough for a static blog that is not deployed very often.\nThere is an action automatically created for our Github page called pages-build-deployment which, as the name implies, builds and deploys the page you've created on push. The way that I organized my code, which is probably the simplest option, is that I hosted my code at the main branch and had a gh-pages branch that hosted the actual website which was built from the main branch. If you want to do the same, go to Settings -&gt; Pages and make sure that the build target is the gh-pages branch at the root.\nFor now, this won't do anything because we don't have a gh-pages branch or anything in our main branch. So how do we actually make our website?\nZola\nZola is a static site generator written in Rust, and is one of the fastest out there. I decided to choose it for my website. If you'd prefer a different generator, this is where this guide diverges for you. There are plenty of tutorials for Hugo websites or others, but I have found a lack of Zola guides so I decided to create this.\nTo start, install Zola on your system. The documentation on the website is pretty stellar so I would recommend reading that to get a quick understanding on how to use Zola. I will explain the parts that I personally found difficult or unclear.\nzola init\nzola build # unnecessary as serve will also automatically build it\nzola serve\n\nNow you can see your new website at 127.0.0.1:1111!\nZola Deployment\nAlthough we can build your website very simply on our local machine, it would be preferable to automatically build the website when we publish content so we don't have to mess around with all of that. The Zola-approved way to do this is by using zola-deploy-action. All of you have to do is click the New Workflow button on the Actions page from your Github repository and follow the link to set up a workflow yourself, then copy-paste this into it:\n# On every push this script is executed\non: push\nname: Build and deploy GH Pages\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: build_and_deploy\n        uses: shalzz/zola-deploy-action@v0.14.1\n        env:\n          # Target branch\n          PAGES_BRANCH: gh-pages\n          # Provide personal access token\n          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}\n\nHowever, I wanted more configuration and control over my action. Github Actions operates using Jekyll by default, so unless you add a .nojekyll file to the build branch it will run unnecessary steps to build a Jekyll theme. In order to reduce complexity, I decided to make a similar action that adds that command. If you're comfortable with the workflow as provided, then skip the next section.\nCreating a Github Action\nAn action of the type we want here consists of three files: action.yaml, Dockerfile, and entrypoint.sh. Let's break these down.\n\naction.yaml: the configuration file that tells Github Actions what to do\nDockerfile: the configuration file for the Docker container that Github Actions will set up\nentrypoint.sh: the shell script that will execute the commands we want\n\naction.yaml is simple. It should follow this general format:\n# action.yaml\nname: 'ACTION_NAME'\ndescription: 'DESC'\nauthor: 'NAME'\nruns:\n  using: 'docker'\n  image: 'Dockerfile'\n\nThe Dockerfile is more complex and has many more options. I kept mine simple to what is needed, you may have your own preference for Docker images.\n# any Docker image is fine, I prefer debian\nfrom debian:stable-slim\nMAINTAINER NAME &lt;EMAIL&gt;\n\n# for github actions\nLABEL \"com.github.actions.name\"=\"ACTION_NAME\"\nLABEL \"com.github.actions.description\"=\"DESC\"\n\n# locale, I am in the U.S. so I use en_US\nENV LC_ALL C.UTF-8\nENV LANG en_US.UTF-8\nENV LANGUAGE en_US.UTF-8\n\n# standard apt-get + wget and git for getting and building\nRUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y wget git\n\n# get zola on the docker image\nRUN wget -q -O - \\\n\"https://github.com/getzola/zola/releases/download/v0.15.3/zola-v0.15.3-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\" \\\n| tar xzf - -C /usr/local/bin\n\nCOPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh\n\n# give the entrypoint executable permissions\nRUN chmod +x entrypoint.sh\nENTRYPOINT [\"/entrypoint.sh\"]\n\nentrypoint.sh is where all the magic happens. Fundamentally, all that it does is call zola build on the main branch, which builds your website inside the public directory (you can configure this if you so wish). It then commits those website files to the gh-pages branch.\nWe need one more thing before we can create entrypoint.sh; a token. We need to authorize our action to be able to push to gh-pages. You can create a token by going to this page and creating a new token with at least repo rights. You can add the token to your repository by going to Settings -&gt; Secrets -&gt; Actions and creating a new repository secret called TOKEN (or any other name you like).\nWith that token, this is the basic necessities for entrypoint.sh:\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\nset -o pipefail\n\nmain() {\n    git config --global url.\"https://\".insteadOf git://\n    git config --global url.\"$GITHUB_SERVER_URL/\".insteadOf \"git@github.com\":\n\n    # update git submodules (important if you have themes)\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n\n    zola build\n\n    cd public\n\n    # if you want to add any commands do it here e.g. `touch .nojekyll`\n\n    git init\n    git config user.name \"GitHub Actions\"\n    git config user.email \"github-actions-bot@users.noreply.github.com\"\n    git add .\n\n    git commit -m \"Deploy ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY} to ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}:gh-pages\"\n    git push --force \"https://${GITHUB_ACTOR}:${TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}.git\" master:gh-pages\n}\n\nmain \"$@\"\n\nWith all of these settings, this is how your workflow should look:\n# .github/workflows/main.yml\non: push\nname: Build and deploy GH Pages\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: build-and-deploy\n        uses: ./ # wherever your action is in relation to the root of the repo\n        env:\n          TOKEN: ${{secrets.TOKEN}}\n\nThemes\nZola requires a Tera template to render your site for the base site index.html as well as page.html for page-specific settings. You can also use Sass stylesheets if you enable it in your config.toml. Themes are a convenient way to have those built for you so you can get a website looking nice without excessive fiddling. I decided to use the after-dark theme which is based on the Hugo theme of the same name. Since I wanted to make my own modifications to it, I forked it and added the changes I wanted. The easiest way to add a theme for Github pages is to use submodules:\ngit submodule add https://github.com/getzola/after-dark.git themes/after-dark\n\nThe deploy action will take care of updating the submodule as necessary. Just add the theme to your config.toml file and voila!\nAlthough I like the after-dark theme, I might change to a different theme or make my own in the future to accommodate my goals for this website. If that happens, I'll detail that process in another post.\n$\\KaTeX$\nMost of the lecture notes I write incorporate $\\KaTeX$ in some way. I find it an expressive way to write formulas and math expressions when reviewing for tests. after-dark does not provide $\\KaTeX$ support by default, which is part of the reason I forked it.\nMy preferred option for $\\KaTeX$ rendering would be server-side, as I don't plan on pushing very often (perhaps once per day) and Zola compilation is extremely quick. However, after doing some research into previous attempts, I decided it wasn't feasible for now. Perhaps in the future I'll take a stab at implementing it myself, but for now I'll settle for client-side.\nThe $\\KaTeX$ docs give a pretty good description on how to incorporate it into your website. In Tera, all you have to do is enclose those stylesheets/scripts into CSS/JS blocks, respectively. My inspiration came from this pull request. I modified the standard auto-render.min.js script to add standard $\\KaTeX$ $ $ tags.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/making-a-website/","title":"Making a Website with Zola, Github Pages, and Github Actions"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/memory-virtualization/":{"body":"Accessing physical memory can cause big issues if we do it directly. How can we virtualize the memory like the CPU so we can use it efficiently and safely?\n\nLet's think of a super simple one process system. Our OS is located in the lowest part of memory, and everything after that is reserved for the user. Within an address space, we have the stack-heap structure discussed before. There's a big problem, that processes can access the memory that the OS is stored in and modify it. That's not good!\nIf we want multiple processes as well, we want to give processes memory that is managed by the operating system so they do not interfere with each other. Every process should have a self-contained address space.\nWe need dynamic allocation from memory as well so that our programs can become very powerful. The stack is not always sufficient for the programs we want to write. The dynamic heap is where all this memory management magic (say that five times fast) happens.\nMemory accesses are built into movl instructions in the ISA. There are special operations to dereference the location stored in a register and access memory. These are known as load/store operations.\nMemory accesses also happen from the code area by the instruction pointer, though that's typically not shown. If we want to count memory accesses, there is one fetch for every instruction, and another if the instruction is a load/store.\n0x10: movl 0x8(%rbp), %edi\n0x13: addl $0x3, %edi\n0x19: movl %edi, 0x8(%rbp)\n\nIn this example, there are 5 total memory accesses. There is one for every instruction, and each movl is a load/store because one of the operands dereferences a memory pointer.\nTypically, we want to reduce this as much as possible because memory access is really slow, and we can't always rely on the cache.\nSo, what are some strategies to virtualize memory?\nTime Sharing\nWhen we virtualized the CPU, we gave each process the illusion that it had its own CPU that were all running at the same time. The way this was done was through context switches that preserved CPU state in memory. We could do something similar by saving memory to disk when the process isn't running.\nHowever, there is an immediate problem with this: it would be incredibly slow. Disk I/O even with SSDs is several orders of magnitude slower than DRAM, which is itself orders of magnitude slower than cache/register access. Considering how much processes play around with memory, this would be totally infeasible.\nStatic Relocation\nThis is an interesting solution. The instructions stored as static data refer to specific memory locations that are hard coded in the application. However, what we could do is change those pointers and memory to memory that is currently available every time we load the process into memory.\nFor example, imagine the previous example which has instructions at 0x10, 0x13, etc. We could imagine that those memory locations are no longer available, so the OS changes the static code portion to 0x1010, 0x1013, etc. This means that all jmp and load/store instructions would also have to be rewritten as well since they directly refer to memory locations.\nHowever, this translation is pretty expensive, although it is simple to implement. There are also security concerns, as always. There is no reason that the new memory couldn't be located somewhere that it can't go.\nDynamic Relocation\nWe want the power of static relocation, but we need a way to manually protect each process from each other. This is such an important issue that it is usually provided as a hardware component: the Memory Management Unit (MMU). Whenever a process generates a virtual address in its address space, the MMU takes on the job for translating that address into a real address and giving it back to the process. This is a good example of modularization; we don't want to have the process to worry about memory, so we offload that job onto a specialized unit designed for that purpose. The MMU is managed only by the OS, so the user can never access it.\nThere are two general operating modes, as discussed previously: kernel space, and user space. Privileged kernel operations have full power over all of memory and the MMU, and users have to ask the OS for memory through virtual translation.\nAddress Translation\nTo start out with, we will make some assumptions about how address spaces are laid out. They are all contigous spaces in memory of the same size that are smaller than physical memory. As we will see later with segmentation, this assumption will not hold up, but it useful for now.\nIn order to translate a virtual address to a physical address in memory, we need some kind of reference space in memory. This is given by the base and bounds registers, which give the physical memory locations of where the virtual address space starts and ends, respectively. These registers are not part of the regular ISA and are instead part of the previously mentioned MMU, and operating on them requires privilege. The MMU can also throw an exception upon illegal memory access which is handled by our OS.\nOur OS can manage memory in this simple way through the mechanism of a free list, which is a linked list which indicates free spaces, which is also used for malloc.\nAs discussed before, the address space has a structure where the stack grows downward and the heap grows upward. However, if you look at a diagram of this for more than five seconds, you might notice a giant chasm between the stack and heap. Relying on our assumption of a contiguous space of memory, this is a lot of wasted memory. Some address spaces fix this problem through segmentation.\nSegmentation\nAs the name implies, a segmented address space is split into multiple segments with its own base/bounds pair to indicate its logical beginning and end. We can split every piece of the address space into its own segment, so stack goes in one segment, heap goes in another, etc. This way, although the virtual address space has this nice alignment, we are not wasting physical memory with our sparse address space.\nIn order to translate a virtual address, we treat the address as an offset with a segment. For example, if we were trying to access a virtual address in the heap, this would be the formula:\n$$physicalAddress = physicalBase + (virtualAddress - virtualBase)$$\nBefore we allow this translation to take place, however, we must check that the value does not exceed the physical bound. If this is the case, then we have caused the infamous segmentation fault.\nA faster way to do with this masks is through bitwise operations. The top two bits of the address refer to the segment, either the code, stack, or heap. The rest of the address is the offset within the segment. This way, we can perform the bounds check before accessing the physical address by checking if the expression in the parentheses exceeds the virtual bounds.\nHowever, one issue with this means that each segment gets the same maximum size, which is \\(2^{offset}\\). If we want a bigger heap, we're out of luck. We can solve this by tracking instructions instead of bits. For example, an instruction fetch for %rip will come from the code segment, so we don't need to put that in the address that it is in the code segment.\nAnother issue is that the stack segment grows downwards instead of forwards, which means that its segment works differently. We need an extra bit for segments that indicates whether they grow forwards or backwards, which will be set to 0 for the stack and 1 for everything else.\nIf that bit is false, then we subtract the offset from the base instead of adding it as above.\nSharing :)\nSometimes, processes share the same code. It seems wasteful to copy the same code segment every time we have a new process, so modern operating systems implement sharing for code segments. Sharing can be implemented for any segment, but it is most common for code since it's read-only. This is important for dynamically linked libraries since many processes will access the same library, like libc.\nHardware adds extra protection bits to each segment indicating its rwx value similar to a file. If a segment is indicated to be r--, then the OS can secretly share the segment between multiple processes, assured that they will only read it. This concept of a read guard allowing for multiple shared references as opposed to a write guard which only allows for one mutable reference will become very important when we discuss concurrency.\nWe have only been working on a few segments so far, but segmentation could theoretically be extended to as many segments as you want. In order to have fine-grained segments, a segment table is needed to quickly access thousands of segments.\nThere are a few more things that the OS needs to do in order to support segmentation. One is that it must preserve all base-bounds pairs upon a context switch, since the location of the address space is now more complicated. Another is that the growing and shrinking of segments must be managed through sbrk-like system calls that shift the bounds of the heap/stack. The final and most important issues that allocating variable size address spaces runs into the same problems of malloc where external fragmentation is difficult to avoid. Like with malloc, there is no perfect solution, ranging from algorithmic free lists to compact memory which rearranges segments every time a new one is created.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/memory-virtualization/","title":"Memory Virtualization"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/mirrors/":{"body":"Mirrors can interact with light in interesting ways. In fact, reflection and refraction are probably most people's engagement with laws of physics surrounding light in their daily life.\nReflection\nOn a plane mirror, like the kind that you're used to in daily life, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. To clarify some terms: incidence refers to the ray that is going towards the mirror, and reflection refers to the ray that is coming out of the mirror. The normal is a perpendicular line, in this case to the plane of the mirror.\nBecause of this characteristic of plane mirrors, the reflection of an object (or image) will be upright and the same size as the object. The image will be \"inside\" the mirror, which is called virtual. The distance \"within\" the mirror to the image is the same distance from the mirror to the object. This is useful for real life because we want to see most objects the same as they actually exist. However, in physics, sometimes we want to manipulate these variables, and for that we use spherical mirrors.\nA spherical mirror is a mirror that is curved such that it could be cut out of a sphere. It can be either concave or convex (front and back of a spoon).\nThere are two points that are significant to a mirror, the focal point \\(F\\) and the center of curvature \\(C\\). If the mirror was part of a sphere, then the center of curvature would be the center of that sphere. The focal point is where parallel rays intersect after reflection. Both points are on the principal axis of the mirror. The focal point is halfway between \\(C\\) and the center of the mirror.\nIn order to determine how the image of an object looks when reflected off of a mirror, it is useful to construct a ray diagram. The ray diagram is based on three rules (you only need two).\n\n\nan incident ray parallel to the principal axis reflects through \\(F\\)\n\n\nan incident ray that passes through \\(F\\) reflects parallel to the principal axis\n\n\nan incident ray which passes through \\(C\\) reflects on itself\n\n\nMagnification\nThe calculation of the distance and size of an image are governed by the following equations:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{d_o} + \\frac{1}{d_i}\n$$\nwhere \\(d_o\\) is the distance from the mirror to the object and \\(d_i\\) is the same for the image. \nThe magnification \\(m\\) of an image is the ratio of the image size to the object size:\n$$\nm = \\frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\\frac{d_i}{d_o}\n$$\nNow, you might be wondering about how the sign of each value affects these equations. The answer is, a LOT. To think about mirrors intuitively, think about what each sign must mean.\n\n\n\\(f\\) is positive for concave mirrors because the focal point is front, but negative for convex mirrors because it's behind the mirror.\n\n\n\\(d_o\\) is positive for a real object (in front of the mirror), but negative for a virtual object. A virtual object can't generally exist, but you can simulate it using reflected light.\n\n\n\\(d_i\\) is the same, but a virtual image makes more sense.\n\n\n\\(m\\) is obvious, positive for upright and negative for inversion\n\n\nRefraction\nIf you put a straw in your water, the straw will strangely seem to bend at the water's edge and go at an angle. The reason for this is refraction: light will change direction when it passes through a medium. The change in angle is described by Snell's Law:\n$$\nn_1\\sin{θ_1} = n_2\\sin{θ_2}\n$$\nwhere \\(θ_1\\) is the angle of incidence, \\(θ_2\\) is the angle of refraction, and \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the indices of refraction for the corresponding media. The index of refraction is expressed as the ratio between \\(c\\) and the speed of light in the material. If light is very fast in the material, \\(n\\) will be close to 1.\nWhen light passes from a medium with a higher index of refraction to a lower one, there's an angle at which the refracted light will be parallel to the media edge, known as the critical angle \\(θ_c\\):\n$$\n\\sin{θ_c} = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}\n$$\nAt any angle greater than the critical angle, all the light will be reflected and none will be refracted.\n\nThe reason that this is the case can be derived from math. Let's say that light passes from water (1.33) into air (1.00). The critical angle would be equivalent to \\(\\sin^{-1}{\\frac{1.00}{1.33}}\\) or 48.75°.\nWhat would happen if we tried to find the angle of refraction based on Snell's Law if the incident angle is 50°, so greater than the critical angle?\n$$\n1.33 \\cdot \\sin{50°} = 1.00 \\cdot \\sin{θ_2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sin{θ_2} = 1.33 \\cdot \\sin{50°} = 1.019\n$$\nBut there's a problem here! The function \\(\\sin^{-1}{}\\) is not defined for \\(θ\\) greater than 1, so the angle does not exist. This means that refraction does not occur, the light is only reflected.\n\nLens\nThe properties of magnification and refraction are used in lens that are located in glasses, telescopes, microscopes, and even your own eyeball! A lens has two mirrors on either side. If the mirrors are convex, the lens is converging, and if they are concave, the lens is diverging. Every lens has two focal points corresponding to each mirror.\nThe ray diagram for a converging lens follows similar rules to a concave mirror, but instead of thinking of reflected rays, the rays are refracted through the lens.\n\n\nWhen a ray passes through the axis of a lens parallel, it will refract towards the other focal point.\n\n\nWhen a ray passes through a focal point, it will refract parallel through the other side.\n\n\nWhen a ray passes through the center of the lens, it will not bend.\n\n\nThe rules are the same for a diverging lens, though it may not appear that way. All of the rules for a diverging lens are based on a focal point on the other side of the mirror, but fundamentally have the same property.\nAll of the formulas are the same for lens like mirrors, however, the meaning of the signs changes in this context.\n\n\n(f) is positive for converging lens because the focal point is front, but negative for diverging lens because it's behind the lens\n\n\n(d_o) is positive for a real object (same side as light), but negative for a virtual object. A virtual object can't generally exist, but you can simulate it using reflected light.\n\n\n(d_i) is positive for a real image on the opposite side of the light, and negative for a virtual image on the same side of the light.\n\n\n(m) is obvious, positive for upright and negative for inversion\n\n\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/mirrors/","title":"Mirrors"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/multimedia/":{"body":"Streaming multimedia is a relatively new concept in internet technology, but now has become central to the daily media consumption of people around the world.\nMultimedia\nIn contrast to the ordinary messages that encode text, multimedia streaming uses audio or video. Most of the traffic on the internet today is dominated by multimedia streaming, so it's a big deal. Multimedia streaming is different from other kinds of streaming in that latency is of greatest importance, but it is also loss tolerant; if the streaming video is a bit distorted, it's not a big deal. When the delay hits above 150 ms users begin to complain.\nVoIP is a special case where there is media being streamed both ways, where two people speak on the same connection through data networks.\nWe must handle signals differently because we don't have a simple Huffman coding like with text. There are three elements at play that determine the quality of the signal:\n\n\nSampling: how often do you sample the signal for data?\n\n\nQuantization: how many levels/bits represent each sample?\n\n\nCompression: how much are the quantized values compressed?\n\n\nIn order to minimize the amount of data being sent, video streaming will often only send the changes from one frame to the next. Otherwise, the level of fidelity would be infeasible on current internet technology.\nAudio\nAudio is generally ranges from 20 Hz to 22.05 kHz, and speech goes between 200 Hz and 8kHz. Sampling generally occurs up to 8kHz to capture speech, the most important element of audio in general, though it is possible to capture 16kHz for high-fidelity audio.\nQuantization can either be 8 bits or 16 bits, which means there are either \\(2^8\\) or \\(2^{16}\\) levels. That's a difference between 256 and 65,536!\nThe bit rate of samples typically depends on the type of audio being sent. For simple VoIP it will typically be 64Kbps, because it quantized at 8 bits and sampled 8k times per second. Audio will generally be 705.6Kbps from 16 bits of quantization and 44.1k samples per second. Stereo is the most fidelity because it is audio in both ears, so double the bit rate at 1.4112 Mbps. By removing frequencies that the human ear cannot distinguish, the amount of data can be reduced dramatically without altering the end sound.\nVideo\nImages are 2D arrays of pixels at heart. The amount of pixels is resolution, which is typically expressed through a 16:9 aspect ratio as with 1080p or 4K/UHD.\nEvery color has 8 bits, and there are three colors RGB so each pixel will contain 24 bits. That means the raw data for a color image even of size 320×240 will be 7680 bytes! That's a lot for one image. Compression through JPEG, Gif, etc. is typically used to help here.\nVideo is composed of images that are displayed at a certain frame rate. Movies run at 24 FPS, though some rare movies display at 48 FPS. Video games are commonly at either 30 FPS or 60 FPS, but can go even higher.\nIf we imagine a 4k television displaying color images at 60 FPS video, the amount of data transmitted would be \\(4096 \\cdot 2160 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 24\\) which is 12 Gbps!!! We obviously need some kind of compression.\nStreaming\nThe client will typically downloading the first portion of the multimedia and begin consuming it. The rest is downloaded while the client consumes the data, so you don't need to wait for the whole file to be downloaded. If you've ever watched a YouTube video, you can see this in real time as the gray bar overlaid on top of the timeline of the video. The client has a buffer to store that downloaded video which is constantly drained to show the video and filled at times corresponding to network delays.\nHowever, this can cause buffering when the network delay is variable and the client consumes all of its data before the server can produce more. The video will be buffered until more data is received, and you see a still frame on the video while a loading symbol plays over it.\nRTP\nUDP streaming is the traditional type of streaming. As multimedia does not necessarily need to be reliable, UDP is better for reducing latency which is most important for the consumer. The packet has the timestamp of the multimedia so it can be ordered correctly in the client buffer. It also needs certain information like the encoding or whether the audio is for left or right microphone. The protocol used for multimedia that incorporates these is called RTP or Real-time Transport Protocol.\nRTP is a flexible protocol that allows for many types of multimedia to be transmitted.\nThe header includes a timestamp field which increments per sample, which allows for correct timing. It also uses sequence numbers to distinguish between packet loss and silence.\nHTTP\nMost people stream video over their browsers nowadays, which uses HTTP. You might remember that HTTP uses TCP, which is slower than UDP but more reliable. The streaming is slower but more convenient.\nDASH\nDynamic Adaptive Streaming allows for good bandwidth over HTTP. The client is the one that adjusts the request rate from multiple content formats/encoding. For example, the client can request data at a lower bit rate or quality like 480p if it feels that 720p is too slow.\nThe MPD or Media Presentation Descriptor is sent over HTTP and gives information about the different format segments. The client can then request each segment, and the segments can come from different ASes, which works well for CDNs. This is how ads are served over YouTube; the client is the one that decides whether to get an ad or not. This is also why blocking ads on YouTube can be done by an extension to your browser.\nDNS\nThe ID for every YouTube video is a BASE64 11 character string, giving a space of \\(64^{11}\\) possible videos. The ID is mapped to 192 DNS host names so that multiple servers can be accessed for videos. This ID is a special hash of the video ID.\nMultiple ASes can broadcast the fact that they are all reachable to a BGP router, and a BGP router can then choose the shortest path. This is called anycast. This means that for accessing video servers, you can pick the country where the video is hosted quite easily. Let's say you want to access a Japanese video in Japan. It's obviously best to access the Japan server, so that's the closest. However, all 192 servers that host the video will broadcast, so that if the Japan server goes down in an earthquake or something, the other servers are still available for the BGP router to pick from, so they can access, for example, the South Korean server.\nVoIP\nTraditional telephones work over PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), which is autonomous and only designed for telephones. However, as the Internet has gradually taken over the world, a demand was created to include telephony in the Internet. Thus, the VoIP (Voice IP) protocol was born.\nThe voice sound waves are converted into packets and transported as audio through lossy RTP, similar to other forms of multimedia.\nIn order to establish the connection to begin with, SIP or Session Initiation Protocol sets up the VoIP session between two hosts. SIP URLS are similar to email addresses that identify users on a network. Most of the work is lent to the caller in order to type in some identifying information as they typically have a display/keyboard. The URL is mapped to an IP address similar to DNS and email.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/multimedia/","title":"Multimedia Networking"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/network-security/":{"body":"The internet has taken over the world, but with it have come malicious actors. People want to spy on you, scam you, steal from you, or harm you through the internet. Through network security, we can shield potential victims from at least some of these harms.\nAttacks\nAttacks on a network can be performed passively, for example in eavesdropping. The network cannot tell the difference between this passive attack and ordinary traffic because no more traffic is being injected.\nActive attacks, by contrast, are done by changing the kind or amount of traffic. This typically manifests as a DoS (Denial of Service) attack. This is usually a significant increase in traffic which shuts down the network due to congestion. If only one host is attacking the network, then the network can easily shut a particular malicious host out. DoS attacks are usually distributed, hence DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service).\nTeardrop attacks are a modern form of DDoS. Instead of sending lots of useless traffic, all they do is open a new connection with a socket. Even though this is a small operation, when done on large scale, it can tax the memory of a server. We mentioned previously that in order to compensate for fragmentation, routers will keep a memory buffer to store fragments. This can be exploited by malicious packets that are all fragments which will run out the memory of the router.\nThe three main aspects of network security are authentication, confidentiality, and integrity.\n\n\nAuthentication: How do you prove that someone is who they say they are?\n\n\nConfidentiality: How can you hide data from prying eyes?\n\n\nIntegrity: How can you prove that data has not been altered midstream?\n\n\nIn order to protect these, we need a security model.\n\n\nAn algorithm to ensure security that must be well-known.\n\n\nTrusted parties know how to generate secret information.\n\n\nDistribute that information through a secure method.\n\n\nSpecify a protocol for trusted parties to decrypt data.\n\n\nEncryption\nEncryption or cryptography is the encoding of a message in such a way that only the communicating parties can interpret it. That way, if a malicious party tries to read the message, they will be unable to understand it because they cannot decrypt it.\nEncryption has two sides, the encryption algorithm and the decryption key. The algorithm should be publicly available in order to prove that it works. When you feed the decryption key into the algorithm, it will spit out a string associated with only that key.\nThe secret key itself should be long enough that the algorithm cannot easily be broken, but also short enough so that it can be transmitted easily. Fun fact: before minimum password lengths were instituted, the most common password was \"god\".\nThe most basic kind of encryption algorithm is a substitution cipher. By simply replacing letters in a message with another letter with a known mapping, a message can be encoded and decoded. However, it is relatively trivial to break this cipher because the English language has patterns that can identify certain letters better than others.\nYou can increase the complexity of this algorithm through polyalphabetic encryption, where the cipher itself changes after every letter. Famously, this is how the Enigma cipher used by the Nazis during World War II worked.\nTransposition ciphers will change the order of the words as well. This might seem like a really good cipher, unfortunately it can similarly be broken by looking at the structure of language.\nIn order to actually encrypt data, real-world encryption algorithms use a combination of these techniques.\nBut how do we generate the decryption key? There needs to be one for every user, but they need to be as random as possible and nigh impossible to crack, so we can't use plaintext passwords.\nWe can use pseudorandom number generators in order to create a key. A pseudorandom number generator is an algorithm which, starting with some seed, will produce a string of numbers based on that seed which appear to be random. The seed will typically based on some environmental noise that can't be easily predicted, such as the time of day at which the algorithm runs. The generator should be highly sensitive to changes in seed.\nSymmetric Key\nUsing the same key, two parties should be able to both encrypt and decrypt the message. By applying the key to the message, the message should be encrypted, then decrypted.\nThere are two main kinds of symmetric ciphers: stream ciphers, and block ciphers. As the name implies, stream ciphers do bitwise operations on the message and the key in order to get the ciphertext. The bitwise operations can be symmetric, like ⊗. One example of a stream cipher is RC4 which can be used in SSL.\nBlock ciphers have a 1-to-1 mapping of certain blocks of \\(k\\) bits to other blocks, typically 64 bits. This is a good method, but the problem is that the number of mappings balloons massively: in general, it is \\(2^k!\\), which is absolutely massive! It is both exponential and factorial. To simulate such a table, you can use a pseudorandom function.\nDES\nThe Data Encryption Standard is the US encryption standard. It uses a 56-bit symmetric key for 64-bit plaintext input, and it is a block cipher. It is fairly secure for small attacks, but it can be brute force decrypted in less than a day. Its advantage is that there is no analytic exploit in the standard.\nIn order to make DES more secure, we can increase the number of keys to 3, making 3DES. The message is encrypted, decrypted, then encrypted again when run through all three keys. Effectively, there are \\(56 × 3 = 168\\) bits to crack, which is much stronger than 56.\nReplay Attacks\nThis method of symmetric key is vulnerable to a certain kind of attack: the replay attack. Let's say I encrypt a message and mail it to my boss. My boss decrypts the message, and sends me back a confidential message, so we can pass information to each other. But my boss doesn't know my address, he only knows that he can trust me because the message is encrypted using our key.\nWhat if a malicious hacker somehow obtains my encrypted message? If she sends that message to my boss, then my boss will email the hacker back with the confidential information because he thinks that only I have the ability to encrypt messages in that way.\nThe way to protect against this is by using a NONCE value, which is a Number used only ONCE. Let's say I write a random number on my message every time I send a message to my boss. The hacker obtains my message and sends the same message later, with the same random number. My boss knows that the NONCE value cannot be the same and therefore does not trust the hacker with our confidential information.\nThe NONCE doesn't have to be a random number. Many times, it can be a challenge query like asking for my mother's maiden name. Having multiple challenges that are cycled through adds an extra layer of protection.\nRSA\nNowadays, almost all cryptography is done by having two keys: a public key, and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt messages, and private key is used to decrypt messages. The public key is, as might be obvious, publicly available. Someone who wants to send a secure message to me can use my public key to encrypt it. However, only I can use my own private key to decrypt it. Importantly, you should not be able to determine the private key by analyzing the public key. They should be wholly different in nature.\nRSA is the most commonly used implementation of this kind of cryptography. To encrypt a message, take the message and raise it to the power of the public key, mod some \\(n\\). To decrypt said bit pattern, raise it to the power of the private key, again mod the same \\(n\\).\nAuthentication can be done using the passing of challenge messages. A new secret key will be created which is encrypted and decrypted in order to encrypt the data.\nOne problem with RSA is that it's really expensive and slow computation-wise, which is good for security but bad for convenience. In practice, most uses of RSA encryption only use the actual algorithm to encrypt some secret key, which is then used as a simpler cipher for the data between the two parties.\nHash\nHashing is the process of creating a unique-ish value from some data that can be used to verify that data as a signature. It should be fast, not easily irreversible, and not have collisions i.e. no two hashes should be the same.\nThe two most common hash functions are MD5 and SHA-1, which are 128 bits and 160 bits, respectively.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/network-security/","title":"Network Security"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/operational-semantics/":{"body":"What are the formal semantics of how a programming language works, mathematically? That's a broad topic. Operational semantics, which are how programs execute, are narrow enough for one article.\nRules\nThe basis behind the mathematics of operation are based on using rules to define a judgment. The expression e will always evaluate to the value v. We can construct a micro-OCaml through the datatypes exp and value:\neval: exp -&gt; value\n\nThis way of presenting semantics is called a definitional interpreter. eval means exp -&gt; value, and we use interpretations to define the language's meaning.\nGrammar\nIt is useful to define meta-variables which represent categories of syntax. We will list a few here:\n\n\nx: any identifier or variable name\n\n\nn: a numeral value\n\n\ne: any expression\n\n\n::=: meta-syntax for definition\n\n\n|: meta-syntax for variants\n\n\ne ::= x | n | e + e | let x = e in e\n\nThis is an important line which defines what an expression exactly is. Up until now, we have used the term expression quite loosely, so it's good to have an exact definition in operational semantics. An expression is either an identifier, a numeral or a combination of expressions. The last variant may seem a little strange to you, but remember, let expressions are simply replacing identifiers in an expression, so they are also expressions. This is a powerful definition because it fully encompasses the abstract syntax tree (AST).\nWe can define an evaluation as eval: exp -&gt; value where evaluation is the process of turning an expression into a final value (in this case an int only).\nRules of Inference\nIn order to prove the veracity of a judgment, we check its composite rules. For example, let's prove that 1 + 3 ⇒ 4 is true. 1 and 3 are expressions in the sum function which evaluate to their own numeral value. Two values being added together is their sum, which is 4.\nThe notation of rules of inference are used to present rules in formal mathematics:\n$$\\frac{H_1 \\mathellipsis H_n}{C}$$\nIf all the hypotheses are true, then the conclusion is true. If there are no hypotheses, then the conclusion is automatically true (axiom).\nLet's express those same rules about numeral self evaluation and sum expressions in rules of inference:\n$$\\frac{e_1 ⇒ n_1 \\quad e_2 =&gt; n_2 \\quad n_3 \\ \\text{is} \\ n_1 + n_2}{e_1 + e_2 ⇒ n_3}$$\nWe can similarly describe the more complicated rules of let expressions:\n$$\\frac{e_1 ⇒ v1 \\quad e_2\\{v_1/x\\} ⇒ v_2}{\\text{let} \\ x = e_1 \\ \\text{in} \\ e_2 ⇒ v_2}$$\nDerivations\nThe derivation is a process in which we apply rules to an expression in succession. We take our conclusion, then break it up into its constituent rules. If any of the rules need more rules themselves, we break them up too. Think of it like a tree which expands out from the conclusion. Let's use let x = 4 in x + 3 ⇒ 7 as an example.\n$$\\frac{4 ⇒ 4 \\quad \\dfrac{4 ⇒ 4 \\quad 3 ⇒ 3 \\quad 7 \\ \\text{is}\\ 4 + 3}{4 + 3 ⇒ 7}}{\\text{let}\\ x = 4 \\ \\text{in} \\ x + 3&nbsp;⇒ 7}$$\nLet's look at this derivation step by step. First, we start at our conclusion. We say that x = 4 in the let expression. Because 4 is used an expression here, we need to generate the hypothesis that the expression 4 will evaluate to itself, which is true from our reflective axiom. Then, we need to show that the resulting expression 4 + 3 ⇒ 7 is valid, which requires the sum rule of inference. Knowing that 4 and 3 evaluate to themselves and that 7 is the sum of those two values, then we can confirm that hypothesis and therefore the conclusion!\nThe way that we've written this derivation is recursive in nature. This is how definitional interpreters will evaluate expressions; they will search the expression for any constituent and evaluate them in turn in order to evaluate the entire expression.\n$$\\frac{\\text{eval Num } 4 ⇒ 4 \\quad \\text{Plus(Ident(\"x\"), Num 3)}}{\\text{eval Let(\"x\", Num 4, Plus(Ident(\"x\"), Num 3))}}$$\nAll evaluation is mathematical proof. An expression e that provably evaluates to value v is v.\nEnvironment\nFrom a mathematical perspective, an environment is a partial function that maps identifiers to values. Because it's partial, not all possible identifiers are mapped, so some identifiers are undefined.\nThe notation for an empty environment is •, which is undefined for every identifier. We can use notation here like in OCaml lists where we can define arguments as either the nil form • or a mapping cons the rest of the environment. Lookup of a value is similarly recursive like an OCaml list. In fact, in an OCaml definitional interpreter, the environment has type (id * value) list where we can search and match mappings like a regular association list.\nWe can add environment semantics to our previous understandings of judgments like so: A; e ⇒ v. Now, when we use identifiers in expressions, we can search the environment for the equivalent value and substitute it. The environment is the formal way of representing state in an operation.\nConditionals\nSo far all we've done in terms of operational semantics is define variables and perform simple sums on them. One of the greatest powers of programming is the ability to implement control flow: if this, then that. Since we're programming functionally and not imperatively, these conditionals evaluate to expressions, not just operations, so we must have else as well to account for all cases.\nTo accommodate this, we must expand our earlier definition of expressions to include equality and the if expression. The if expression takes an equality expression as a conditional, and if it satisfies the boolean argument then the if body is returned as the evaluation, else the else body.\n\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/operational-semantics/","title":"Operational Semantics"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/other-protocols/":{"body":"Besides the primary Internet protocols, there are some others to learn about, like DHCP, NAT, IPv6, etc.\nDHCP\nWhat happens if a device doesn't have a permanent IP address? You take your phone around multiple mobile networks, there isn't a consistent IP address between them. How do you access the internet without an IP address?\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a client-server protocol that is used in these scenarios. As the name implies, it allows for dynamic IP address allocation that are leased for a certain amount of time. Configuring things like the subnet mask, gateway configuration, etc. to set up an IP is complicated and not feasible for the average user. Imagine if you had to do all that setup everytime your phone moved to a new location!\nDHCP has two main components: the protocol for delivering the bootstrapping information from the server to clients, and the algorithm for dynamically assigning addresses to new clients. How do you start a connection from nothing?\nIn order to allocate a new address, there are three modes. Automatic allocation gives permanent address, dynamic allocation leases addresses, and manual allocation is managed by a system administrator.\nDHCP sends packets over a socket at port 67. Its IPv4 header indicates that it is protocol 17. The UDP packet is sent with no initial IP address because there is none. It is sent with the broadcast server IP address 255.255.255.255. The protocol must also interface with the link layer at the client's MAC address; remember, we're starting at zero. There is also space for the server hostname, boot filename, and several kinds of options.\nThe options indicate what the purpose of the UDP packet is. For example, option 1 is DHCPDISCOVER, which is the message that lets the server know that a client is looking for an IP address. The communication sequence is directly encoded into the options in the packet. Some others:\n\n\nDHCP Offer: server response with parameter proposal\n\n\nDHCP Request: like discover, but focused to a specific server\n\n\nDHCP ACK: server gives IP address to client\n\n\nDHCP NAK: server declines to give IP address to client\n\n\nDHCP Decline: client declines the given IP address\n\n\nDHCP Release: client gives up its IP address\n\n\nDHCP typically applies within a subnet. Relay agents on routers, like with BOOTP, allow servers to handle requests from other subnets.\nNAT\nThere are two kinds of IP addresses: public and private. Private addresses are reserved for 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255. If you send a request to private address, your router will not send it out to the Internet. Private addresses are also free; you can hand out as many as you want without it costing anything.\nHowever, requests sent from a private IP address cannot access the Internet. In order to access the Internet, we use a Network Address Translation box. This NAT box is assigned a single public IP address and it is the public-facing IP for all of the machines with private addresses on it.\nThis is likely how your home router works. Each device in your home only has a private address and every time it sends a request to the Internet, that request is sent to the NAT box in your router and translated to one single public IP for all of the machines in your house.\nThe NAT box will take in packets that are sent from private IP addresses and record the packet address in a table, then replace the IP address with its own and its port with some random port. When packets are sent back to that address, the NAT box consults its table and sends the packets back to the correct private IP address based on the port it was sent on.\nAlthough there are technically \\( 2 ^ {24} \\) addresses, in practice you can only have less than \\( 2 ^ {16} \\) addresses because each of those needs to have an associated port, and that's a 16-bit number (minus some reserved ports).\nBut why would you do this? Remember that IPv4 is a 32-bit number for addresses, which only allow for ~ 4 billion unique devices. Clearly, there will be, and perhaps already are, more devices that use the Internet than that. IPv6 was created in part to solve that problem, but as many devices only accept IPv4, this works in the meantime. It also provides security to users since ports aren't accessible from the public, they are instead randomly assigned. Even if someone's IP address is tracked, the malicious agent still doesn't necessarily know what device the request is from.\nIPv6\nIPv6 is an updated protocol from IPv4 that is optimized for the needs of the modern day. It is significantly simplified compared to IPv4 as much of the machinery in an IPv4 header relates to problems that generally no longer exist. However, the header size is also 40 bytes, twice as large as the IPv4 header. This is because the new source and destination IP address that must be stored in the header are now 16 bytes, not 4, the vast majority of the header size is dominated by address size.\nIPv6 does not protect against some problems that still exists, such as bit flips. If that happens, the packet is simply dropped because a different layer will do a checksum.\nVersionTraffic ClassTraffic ClassFlow LabelFlow LabelFlow LabelFlow LabelFlow Label\nPayload LengthPayload LengthPayload LengthPayload LengthNext HeaderNext HeaderHop LimitHop Limit\n\nfollowed by the source address and destination address, along 4-bit boundaries\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/other-protocols/","title":"More Internet Protocols"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/packet-switching/":{"body":"How do we get the best performance in sending information over the internet? What is packet switching and how can it help?\n\nPerformance is bottlenecked by propagation delay and transmission time.\nPropagation delay is dictated by the physical distance between the client and server. If you were to send a message to server on Mars, there would be 200 million km to travel across, aka 1000s at the speed of light! New York to Los Angeles is about 20ms at this same speed of 5μs/km.\nTransmission time is dictated by bandwidth, which tells you how many bytes per second you can send. 1MB/s link speed will take 1ms for 1000B. The reason this happens is because as soon as the first bit is propagated, all the rest of the bits will follow which will be concentrated by bandwidth, 1μs after each other with this link speed.\nFor small messages in the tens or hundreds of bytes like handshake acknowledgements, propagation delay is very significant. For larger messages, propagation delay is ignored and bandwidth is considered more significant.\n$RTT = 2PD$: Round-trip time is equal to twice the propagation delay.\nPacket switching is faster because it is a continuous stream.\nAssume 1000B/s link speed between sender and destination. If we do message switching, it is slow. A 1000B would take 1s (duh) to go from sender to router. Similarly, it would take another second to go from router to destination, so 2 seconds in total.\nLet's assume we split our 1000B message into 100B packets. The first packet will take 0.1s to arrive to the router and another 0.1s to arrive at the destination, so 0.2s. Each packet follows directly after the other, so the second packet takes only 0.1s total because it's already at the router by the time the first packet is at the destination. In total, the message takes 1.1s to travel.\nThese benefits compound when messages are passing over multiple routers, because only the first packet has to deal with the overhead of the link speed for all the routers. All the rest of the packets will only take the time for the link speed between the last router and the destination.\nHowever, bottlenecks can still occur when link speeds between routers are different. The weakest link will bottleneck the connection even in packet switching.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/packet-switching/","title":"Packet Switching vs Message Switching"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/paging/":{"body":"The main problem that segments have introduced to managing memory space is that their variable size wastes memory through fragmentation. Fixed-size pieces that are easier to handle are much more popular: these are known as pages.\nPages\nAddress spaces are split up into multiple pages, typically a power of 2. For example, let's picture a tiny 6-bit address space that can only address 64 bytes. We could split it up into four 16-byte pages, that we'll refer to in sequence.\nThe physical representation of these pages is through page frames, which are sequenced directly in memory and are ordered. The pages in the virtual address space map directly to page frames in physical memory, with no respect for order.\nMemory management of the free space here can be done with a simple free list. All it needs to look for is four free page frames somewhere in memory and map each page to a page frame. This mapping is stored in a page table which is kept per process, since every process has its own address space.\nPage Translation (IMPORTANT)\nIn our example from earlier, we worked with a 6-bit address space. The highest order bits are reserved for the virtual page number, and the lower bits are reserved for the offset within the page. For example, the virtual address 21 would be 010101 in binary. The top two bits 01 tell us that we are looking for virtual page 1. The OS checks the page table and sees that VP2 maps to physical frame 7, which is 111 in binary. The OS then translates the physical address by replacing the VP bits with the PF bits. In this example, the new address would be 1110101, or the 117th byte in memory.\nPage Tables\nWe've talked about page tables a bit, but let's go into details. They are a data structure like any other, but they can get very large. Each mapping in the table, which is called a page table entry (PTE), is typically \\(2^2\\) bytes in size. It's often simpler to think of these calculations in terms of the bits involved, since they will always be a power of two. With that in mind, this is the formula for page table size:\n$$ pageTableSize = VPN + PTE $$\nThat's 22 bits for a typical 32-bit system, which is pretty massive at 4MB per page table, which is again per process. We obviously can't keep this in the MMU, so we need to actually store it in memory.\nHow do we organize the page table as a data structure? The most obvious way is as a linear table, aka an array. The VPN is an index in the array, and the value at the index is the PTE which gets the PFN. The PTE itself contains the PFN plus some helpful bits for us. There is a valid bit checks if the mapping even exists, protection bits for privileged memory, and others.\nThis access is still extremely slow for load store operations. We need a better solution!\nTLB\nThe hardware comes to the rescue here. MMUs provide a translation-lookaside buffer to cache commonly used translation. When a load-store instruction is executed, the CPU will first check the TLB if there exists a translation for the specified address if it exists. If it does, then it can quickly perform the operation without performance overhead of going back and forth on memory so often. If it doesn't, the CPU hands the reins over to the OS to do its own page and offset translation and it will cache the translation after the OS gives it. Here's the basic steps:\n\n\nextract VPN from virtual address\n\n\ncheck if VPN is in TLB\n\n\nif hit, then perform the PFN concatenation and access the memory\n\n\nif miss, hardware will check the page table to find the translation\n\n\nupdate the TLB with the translation\n\n\nretry TLB, now a guaranteed hit\n\n\nAll of this assumes that memory is valid, accessible, and unprivileged; these can cause exceptions that the OS will handle.\nStep 4 is expensive and it is therefore the step that we want to avoid as much as possible. Luckily, many memory accesses reside on the same page. For example, arrays are almost guaranteed to have the same TLB hit because they are organized contiguously. Spatial locality helps us increase our hit rate.\nPage size is also significant here. By having big pages, typically 4KB, we are unlikely to have TLB misses since the same page is accessed for this memory. Temporal locality will also help here, as the TLB will evict based on recency.\nThe TLB miss can be managed by either the CPU or the OS. Older CISC or complex-instruction set computers managed the TLB themselves, while modern RISC reduced computers raise an exception to be handled by the OS. In these computers, steps 4 and 5 are handled by the OS and step 6 only executes after the exception is handled.\nThe exception raised here is a little different from other exceptions. Typically, instructions that raise exceptions are skipped. Here, we want to retry the operation, so we need to get a different program counter.\nThe TLB cache is fully associative which means that any translation can be anywhere. This means that the VPN is encoded with the PFN and other bits.\nOne small note is that the TLB entries have valid bits just like the PTE, but they serve different purposes. In the TLB, it refers to a valid translation. If a context switch has occurred, for example, then all of the cache becomes invalidated. PTE valid bits refer to unallocated memory which results in a process kill.\nLet's examine that cache invalidation. Flushing the cache on every context switch seems to miss the point of a TLB since it happens so often. What are other ways we can manage this? Hardware will typically add an ASID (address space identifier), which is similar to a PID but contains less information. This way, a TLB can contain information for multiple processes without accidental contamination.\nSmaller Tables\nAs discussed earlier, page tables can get real honking big, which is not good for memory consumption. TLBs can mitigate the performance problems of page table access, but we need better ways to mitigate memory usage of our page tables.\nThe obvious solution, also mentioned earlier, is to just increase the size of each page. The size of a page in \\(2^{bits}\\) is given by:\n$$ addressSpace = numberOfPages + pageSize $$\nso if we have a 32-bit address space, we can have 18 bits for our number of pages and 14 bits for our 4 KB page. 1 MB per page table is better because it's smaller, but there's a limit to this kind of strategy. If we make our pages too big, we will get internal fragmentation within each page, where an entire page is allocated but not that much memory within it is used, leading to waste. 4 KB is a good middle ground, which is why that's what x86 uses.\nSegmentation-Paging\nWe looked at segmentation earlier, but initially dismissed it due to its issues of variable size. What if we combined the two approaches into a hybrid? Instead of having one giant page table for the address space, what if we split it up into segments?\nWe can twist around the base/bounds registers to use them for a different purpose. The base register can hold the physical address of the actual page table for a particular segment, and the bounds will tell us where the physical end of the page table is. We can use these values to calculate the number of valid pages.\nAgain, let's use the top two bits to refer to segment. We'll figure out our base/bounds pair from the those bits, then get to our PTE by adding \\(VPN \\cdot sizeof(PTE) \\) to it. The bounds register can be used to track our number of valid pages so they don't take up space in the page table if they are not used. However, this comes with the same issues of segmentation earlier: external fragmentation.\nMulti-level Page Tables\nAs is common for many problems, the solution for page tables is to put them inside another page table. Multi-level page tables are the de facto solution for page tables that are used in x86. However, this introduces a significant amount of complexity in our page table search, so we will need to examine that.\nWe will chop up our page table into its own kind of pages, each of which only contain PTEs. If an entire page of PTEs is all invalid, which means that none of them have valid translations, don't allocate that page. In order to manage this apparatus, we will introduce a new data structure: the page directory.\nYou can think of the page directory as a simple page table if the only memory being tracked was the sub-page table. Each entry has a valid bit which is true if any PTE in its mapped page is valid, as well as the PFN where the page of PTEs is stored. That PFN is only allocated if the valid bit is set.\nIf we organize this structure correctly, each chunk of the page table that we refer to as \"pages\" are actually page-sized and can fit into memory pages in kernel space. This greatly simplifies page table management.\nHowever, there is a cost, as always. TLB misses require two memory loads in order to get the correct page because of the level of indirection that page directories introduce. Since TLB misses are rare, we take that tradeoff in return for significantly reduced memory consumption. This is a trade for space that sacrifices time.\nLet's get some numbers for a multi-level page table. Assume a 14-bit virtual address space split into 8 bits for VPN and 6 bits for offset. Remember that this translates to 256 entries per table and a page size of 64 bytes.\nWe have to do some special bit magic to manage these page levels as well. In this example, our page table size is 10 bits; remember, it's VPN + PTE. We need to subtract our offset bits from that size to get 4 bits for number of pages, then subtract our PTE bits from that to get number of PTEs per page. In total, here is the formula:\n$$ pageTableSize = numberOfPages + \\underbrace{pageSize}_{PTESize + PTEPerPage} $$\n\\(10 = 4 + (2 + 4)\\) in this example.\nThe page directory size is the same as the number of pages, so it is also 4 bits. When doing our translation, the highest order bits of the VPN are reserved for the page directory index. After indexing using these higher bits, the rest of the bits of the VPN are the \"offset\" within the page that the higher bits point to. You can think of this is as a mini address with the VPN being the PDI and the offset being the page table index (PTI).\nInfinity and Beyond\nThis example presented has only two levels, the page directory and the page table. But we can go deeper. Let's reset our numbers to 30 bit address space and 9 bit page size. The VPN is therefore 21 bits.\nIf we apply the same formula as before here, we end up with 7 bits for PTEPerPage. The lowest bits of the VPN will be reserved here. Our page directory will now have 16 bits (14 + 2 for each entry), but this is WAY too much. We need every piece of our structure to fit into a page, so we need to get the PDI to 7 bits or less.\nThe solution here is to further split the PDI into another VPN/offset split. The offset here will be 7 bits, as this is what fits into the page.\nThe zeroeth index is the VPN part, which is 7 bits. It can address 128 pages of the second-level directory. The second-level directory will address 128 pages of PTEs. This way, both the first and second level directory are 9 bits (index + entry size) so they fit into a page!\nThis is really hard to understand! Try to think of it where every level is a split between index and offset. The first offset must always be the size of a page, and every inner offset must be the size of page minus the PTE size. In this case, the first offset was 9 bits, and every directory offset was 7 bits. To get the maximum level \\(n\\), the formula is:\n$$ addressSpace &gt; (pageSize - PTESize) \\cdot (n - 1) + pageSize $$\nOur maximum level in this example is 3, because a level of 4 would result in \\((9 - 2) \\cdot (4 - 1) + 9\\) which is 30, the same as the address space, which must be greater.\nInverted Page Tables\nA small coda to this discussion of paging is the inverted page table. Unlike other kinds of page tables, this is a page table that is shared between processes that maps every physical page. This massive table has information per entry about what process is using it, the virtual page number that the process using is referring to, and the physical page. PowerPC uses this model, with a hash table instead of an array to speed up lookups.\nHowever, lookups are still slow, although they take up less memory. It is also difficult to implement sharing as specified earlier. You need to somehow chain multiple virtual addresses to one entry, which introduces serious complexity.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/paging/","title":"Paging"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/particles/":{"body":"Tiny particles are affected in different ways than we are by waves. There are several different effects that must be discussed.\nThe Photoelectric Effect\nMany people believe that Albert Einstein won the Nobel Prize for his discovery of special relativity, as that is what he is most well-known for. However, his actual claim to fame in that respect had to with the photoelectric effect. He found that when light of a certain wavelength is incident on certain metals, electrons are ejected from the surface of the metal.\nThe number of photoelectrons emitted, the photocurrent, increases with intensity, though the kinetic energy does not. The kinetic energy only increases with an increase in energy of the light i.e. a decrease in the wavelength. Above a certain wavelength, no electrons are ejected.\n$$\n\\frac{hc}{λ_0} = W_0 + KE_{max}\n$$\nwhere \\(W_0\\) is the work function for the metal in question. You can think of it as an intrinsic quality of the metal. \\(λ_0\\) is the cutoff wavelength after which no more electrons will be ejected.\nPair Production/Annihilation\nWhen a high energy photon collides with a nucleus, it may \"split\" into an electron and a positron. When this split happens, the charge, momentum, and the mass-energy of all parties must be conserved:\n$$\nE_{photon} = KE_{positron} + KE_{electron} + 2E_0\n$$\nwhere \\(E_0\\) is the rest mass-energy for each particle given by \\(E = mc^2\\), doubled since the electron and positron are identical.\nThe opposite operation can occur when an electron and a positron combining will annihilate the pair and create two identical photons with opposite momentum. The reason that there must be two photons and not just one is that the momentum must equal 0, so there has to be opposite momentum.\nde Broglie Wavelength\nAll particles exhibit wave-like characteristics, which can be demonstrated by the double-slit experiment. The wavelength of a particle in this instance can be determined from the following equation:\n$$\nλ = \\frac{h}{p} = \\frac{h}{mv} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2mKE}}\n$$\nThe wavelength of a photon is a little different, since photons are completely massless. The momentum and energy of a photon are related by a simpler equation \\(E = pc\\), which applies to all massless particles, not just photons.\nUncertainty\nOne key problem for physicists studying particles is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In layman's terms, the observation of a particle fundamentally changes its quality, so it can never be truly measured. In mathematical terms, the accuracy of a measurement of a position's momentum and position at the same time is limited:\n$$\n(Δp_y)(Δy) ≥ \\frac{h}{4π}\n$$\nand the same function exists for simultaneous measurements of energy and time.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/particles/","title":"Particles"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/prolog-control/":{"body":"Conditional statements are very powerful and are in used in almost every language. How does Prolog implement the same idea?\nLogic + Control\nThe basic idea behind a control statement is that there is logic, such as facts, rules, and queries, which are composed of clauses/goals, as well as control, which is how Prolog chooses the logic among several options. The control is implemented by the order of the facts/goals, which is extremely important. Prolog will always choose the first applicable rule in a program, and it will always choose the leftmost clause/goal in a query.\nBrevity is key. If there are two rules that do the same thing, or one rule that is implied by another rule, you should probably take it out unless executing something more than once is your explicit intention.\nAbstract Interpreter\nA substitution \\(σ\\) is a finite set of pairs of terms \\(\\{X_1/t_1, ..., X_n/t_n\\}\\) where each \\(t_i\\) is a term and each \\(X_i\\) is a variable such that \\(X_i ≠ t_i\\) and \\(X_i ≠ X_j\\) if \\(i ≠ j\\).\nAn empty substitution is denoted by the letter \\(ε\\).\nSome important rules:\n\n\nA variable cannot substitute itself e.g. \\(Z/Z\\) is illegal.\n\n\nOnly a variable can be substituted e.g. \\(m/n\\) is illegal because \\(m\\) is an atom.\n\n\nThe meaning of applying a term to a substitution is that every occurrence of \\(X_i\\) in the compound term is replaced with the corresponding substituent in \\(σ\\) simultaneously. This application is known as instantiation, and that new compound term \\(Eσ\\) is an instance.\nBringing back the earlier rules about unification, you can see how unification is derived from substitution. Variables can unify with anything, so they are the term that is substituted in Prolog. There is an exception to this, which is known as the occurs check.\nWe can use a substitution \\(σ\\) as a unifier for two terms if the application of \\(σ\\) to those terms makes them syntactically equal. This is distinct from semantic equality. When we talk about unifiers, we are only talking about the actual letters, not the meaning of the term. For \\(S = f(X,Y)\\) and \\(T=f(g(Z),Z)\\), if we have a \\(σ = \\{X/g(Z),Y/Z\\}\\) then \\(S\\) and \\(T\\) will be unified. Since the unification only cares about syntax, more than one unifier may exist for two terms. We could have just as well substituted the other way and it would still be a unifier.\nUnifier Computation\nunify(X, Y, θ) =\n  X = Xθ\n  Y = Yθ\n  case X is a variable that does not occur in Y:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return (θ{X/Y} ∪ {X/Y}) // this replaces X with Y in the unifier, and then adds a new substitution just in case X will appear later\n  case Y is a variable that does not occur in X:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return (θ{Y/X} ∪ {Y/X}) // this replaces Y with X in the unifier. this is a rare case when the variables substitute each other\n  case X and Y are identical constants\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return Θ\n&nbsp;&nbsp;case X and Y are compound terms like f(X1, ..., Xn) and f(Y1, ..., Yn)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return (fold_left (fun Θ (X,Y) -&gt; unify(X, Y, Θ)) θ [(X1, Y1), ..., (Xn, Yn)]\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this applies the unification process to the compound terms\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the function is just folding left with θ as acc and the set of compound terms as the list\n\nThis is the basic pseudocode for the unify function. It's recursive, and side-effect free. However, it's not complete for writing an interpreter. For that, we also need backtracking.\nBacktracking\nThe resolvent will maintain a list to satisfy our query. When we try to resolve a compound term, any goals within will be queued onto the resolvent to be resolved. This is non-deterministic, there is no order that will necessarily be followed other than that sub-goals within a single term will be inorder.\nMissionaries and Cannibals\nLet's imagine a problem where we have three missionaries and three cannibals that need to cross a river in one boat. If the cannibals outnumber the missionaries, they will get eaten. How can we get every person across the river?\nThe concept of a safe state will be important here. A state is safe when no missionaries are eaten. By labelling certain states as unsafe, we can cut those paths out of our search algorithm. We should also define transitions between states, where a predicate moves a state from A to B. \nOur states are essentially a pair representing position.\nstart(3-3-0-0-l).\nfinish(0-0-3-3-_).\n\nThe elements in order are missionaries on the original side, cannibals on the original side, missionaries on the target side, cannibals on the other side, and the location of the boat.\nThe safety of the state is based on whether there are more cannibals than missionaries.\nsafe(0-_-M2-C2-_) :- M2 &gt;= C2.\nsafe(M1-C1-0-_-_) :- M1 &gt;= C1.\nsafe(M1-C1-M2-C2-_) :- M1 &gt;= C1, M2 &gt;= C2.\n\nEvery state here represents a point at which there are at least as many missionaries as cannibals on each side of the river.\nThe change in state can be caused by a carry/2 predicate which details how many missionaries and cannibals are being moved, respectively. In our case, the boat can only move up to 2 people so we need to represent every possible case of that.\ncarry(2, 0).\ncarry(1, 1).\ncarry(0, 2).\ncarry(1, 0).\ncarry(0, 1).\n\nHowever, we need a way to represent moving on both sides of the river, so we will have two transitions.\nstep(M1-C1-M2-C2-l, M3-C3-M4-C4-r) :-\n    carry(X, Y),\n    M1 &gt;= X, M3 is M1 - X, M4 is M2 + X,\n    C1 &gt;= Y, C3 is C1 - Y, C4 is C2 + Y.\n\nstep(M1-C1-M2-C2-r, M3-C3-M4-C4-l) :-\n    carry(X, Y),\n    M2 &gt;= X, M4 is M2 - X, M3 is M1 + X,\n    C2 &gt;= Y, C4 is C2 - Y, C3 is C1 + Y.\n\nThis step predicate checks every valid carry, then will execute that transition from the current state.\ntravel(A, A, _, []).\ntravel(A, C, Visited, [B | Steps]) :-\n\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/prolog-control/","title":"Control in Prolog"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/prolog/":{"body":"Prolog is a special programming language that is not like many others. It exemplifies the paradigm of logic programming.\nTerms\nFunctional programming is based on the idea that all operations exist using functions that give the same output for a given input. Imperative programming is based on the idea that we can manipulate variables and order them around like soldiers. Logic programming takes propositional logic from discrete structures and turns it into a language.\nEvery program is made up of terms, which are constants, variables, and compound terms. A constant is any word that is lowercase, whether it be a number, a string, or just a word. A variable is a word that begins with a capital letter.\nCompound terms are relations. Relations in the logical sense are a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets, where the result set consists of elements that are contained in both. The top level name is the functor, and the number of arguments is the arity. For example, a compound term might be male(robb) where male is the functor with an arity of 1. The order of arguments within the compound term matters!\nFacts are a knowledge base for a particular program. Each fact is a compound term showing a relation, followed by a period. Rules are a generality on facts where they are facts given assumptions. A fact is just a rule that is true without assumptions. The order of facts/rules is very important to the execution of code! Prolog reads from top to bottom, so the most important facts/rules should be placed near the beginning.\nfather(rickard, ned).\nfather(rickard, brandon).\nfather(rickard, lyanna).\nfather(ned, robb).\nfather(ned, sansa).\nfather(ned, arya).\n\nQueries\nOnce we have our knowledge base, we can query for information.\n?- father(ned, sansa).\n\nThis query will return true because it is in our list of facts. However, what happens if we query something it doesn't know?\n?- father(ned, bran).\n\nProlog operates on the closed world assumption, which means that it only knows what it's been told. If it doesn't know something, it will assume falsity. So Prolog will say the Ned is not Bran's father, despite it having no idea whether that is the case.\nThere are also existential queries. Instead of asking a boolean question, it asks if a fact exists.\n?- father(ned, X).\n\nThis query asks for all the relations father where ned is the first argument. It will return\nX = robb ;\nX = sansa ;\nX = arya .\n\nin the order that the facts are laid out. The semicolon is the logical OR in Prolog, so it's saying that either one of the results is true. It would return false if there are no facts that satisfies the query.\nRules\nRules in general can be any logical statements from facts that are inferred inductively. The general form is\nH :- B1, B2, B3, ..., BN\n\nmeans that the head H is true if B1 ∧ B2 ∧ B3 ... etc.\nparent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).\n\nmeans that the relation parent exists between X and Y as long as the relation father exists between X and Y. We can construct rules recursively as well:\nancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y)\nancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), ancestor(Z, Y)\n\nThis defines ancestor in two ways. The first rule says that X is an ancestor of Y as long as X is a parent of Y. The second rule introduces an additional definition where X is an ancestor of Y as long as X is a parent of some Z which is an ancestor of Y.\nWe can almost think of this like a list, where parent means adjacent and ancestor means inorder. Of course two elements are inorder if they are adjacent, that's the first rule. However, if we can imagine a long list, two elements are inorder if the adjacent element to X is inorder previous to Y! The logic applies in any general situation; this is the advantage of the logical paradigm.\nUnification\nThe core of how Prolog will compute answers is through unification, which is similar to pattern matching. It has three unification conditions:\n\n\nidentical constants will be unified\n\n\nvariables will always unify\n\n\ncompound terms will unify if functor and arity match as well as their arguments, recursively (using the top two rules)\n\n\nLists\nData structures seem pretty incongruent with our idea of logical programming so far. Lists are defined similarly to OCaml as recursive data structures.\n[1, 2, 3, 4] % list\n[] % nil\n[H | T] % head cons tail\n\nTo find the last element of a list, we can use this rule\nlast([H], H).\nlast([_ | T], V) :- last(T, V).\n\nThe first rule is the base case, where if there is only one element in a list, that element is the \"last element\". Then, the second rule is recursively defined. If the first argument \nArithmetic\nThe arithmetic operators are built into Prolog, and are built as relations between terms. Arithmetic equality is not the same thing as unification. If you want to check for arithmetic equality, you must use is.\nThe is operator evaluates the right hand expression and unifies the expression with the left. There can be variables present, but the variables need to be defined as some ground value. You can't create an algebraic equation using is.\nBasic arithmetic operators are also built in, but only operate on numerals. If you try to apply, for instance, +, to lowercase word constants, there will be an error.\nBacktracking\nProlog computes the length of a list very similar to OCaml. An example OCaml length function might be:\nlet rec len l =\n    match l with\n    | [] -&gt; 0\n    | h :: t -&gt; len t + 1\n\nThe Prolog rules are similar:\nlen([], 0).\nlen([H | T], N) :- len(T, M), N is M + 1.\n\nThe relation len with arity 2 defined on the empty list maps to 0, obviously. The relation len with arity 2 and the first argument being a list with head and tail is the actual recursive part we are interested in.\nYou might raise an eyebrow at the use of is in the second rule; after all, didn't I just say that the right hand side must have ground terms? We don't know what M is!\nActually, we do know. You can think of the order of clauses as the imperative definition of variables. The variable M is declared and initialized with the first len clause, and it can then be used in the second clause. If we put the second clause first, Prolog would raise an error.\nYou might notice a pattern here. The function is almost identical to the OCaml function, except for one difference. In the functional paradigm, every function evaluates to an expression which is returned within the function, and those are the values that are used for every operation. In the logical paradigm, there is no implicit return. len(T, M) is the same thing as M = len(T)!\nThe length is computed using backtracking. It will try every possible rule for len and then evaluate every single one. You can think of a depth first search of the tree of rules.\nEvery point at which there are multiple branches is called a choice point. In the len example, it can choose to either check the fact for [] or the recursive rule.\nBacktracking can cause unexpected results. Say we try to query\n?- len(A, 2)\n\nWe're querying for a list of size 2 which doesn't exist. What would happen?\nWell, Prolog will try to find a matching branch to an existing rule. It will fail the first rule most of the time, so it will match the second rule. Because M = N - 1, when trying to find M it will subtract from the second argument and backtrack. It will eventually match to return the result A = [h1, h2]; when it matches 0 as the length and backtracks to adding arbitrary variables to the list of T.\nBut then something unexpected happens. After printing that last result, Prolog would spin on and on, never returning again. That's because although we have matched the first rule and returned a list, Prolog will try every rule to see if it matches. And in fact, the second rule does match [T2, 0] because a variable will match any value. Prolog will endlessly backtrack because a choice will always be available that can match the new recursion. This is much different from OCaml which will only execute the first match arm that matches. You need to be careful in Prolog in order to prevent this kind of result.\nTail Recursion\nOur len function is not tail recursive, since it adds on to the recursive call. In order to optimize our code, including an accumulator will aid because of tail recursion which we have discussed before.\nlen2([], Acc, Acc).\nlen2([H | T], Acc, N) :- M is Acc + 1, len2(T, M, N).\n\nWhat we've done here is shift the is clause before the recursive call, which means we don't need to hold on to that choice when recursively calling len2, since it's guaranteed to already be checked.\nYou might ask, why do we even need to have that is clause? We might as well directly call len2(T, Acc + 1, N). However, there's an issue here. The len2 relation only unifies terms, which is a powerful operation, but it does not evaluate them. For a list [1, 5, 7, 3] it would show N = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, not N = 4 which would be correct. In order to make this correct, we need to evaluate the addition before making the recursive call into the second clause because that clause does not perform any evaluation.\nThis means that when we call len2 we need to do len2([], 0, X). This is a little annoying; we always know that our accumulator will begin at 0, why do we need to include it? There is a way to elide this definition:\nlen2([)\n\nAppend\nAnother instructive example is the simple list append.\nlet rec append p q:\n    match p with\n    | [] -&gt; q\n    | [h :: t] -&gt; h :: (append t q)\n\nappend([], Q, Q).\nappend([H | P], Q, [H | R]) :- append(P, Q, R).\n\nPrefix/Suffix\nFor a given list, we can place a separator in the list. Every element prior to the separator is the prefix and every element after is the suffix. The separator can be anywhere, including before or after every element.\nWe can get all possible prefixes/suffixes for a list for all separators:\n?- prefix(X, [1, 2, 3]).\n\nX = [];\nX = [1];\nX = [1, 2];\nX = [1, 2, 3].\n\nLet's think about how to build this out logically. We need to find all lists which are possible prefixes of this list. That means we don't want to capture, for example, [2, 3], because that is not a possible prefix. We have to start from the left and include from there.\nprefix([], []).\n\nThe empty list should map onto the empty list, naturally\nGenerate and Test\nWe need a general approach to solve problems from a Prolog standpoint. The paradigm is very different from imperative or functional, so we can't just look at it the way that that OCaml or Java does.\nLet's make take, which will remove exactly one element x from a list.\ntake([H | T], H, T).\ntake([H | T], R, [H | S]) :- take(T, R, S).\n\nThe first rule is the most obvious. If the element is at the head of the list, we can just return the tail of the list. This is our base case.\nThe second rule maps onto the case in the middle of the list. To imagine this, let's use an example\n?- take([1, 2, 3], 2, T).\n\nWe try to unify this to the first rule, but it fails because 2 is not at the head of the first list. The second rule will unify because the first element is a list with multiple values, the second is a variable that will unify anything, and the third element is a variable that will unify anything. Upon match, it will query take([2, 3], 2, S). This query will unify with the first rule, which will replace S with the value [ 3 ]. Once that S is unified, the rule will backtrack to the initial query which asked for [H | S]. Well, H in that initial case was 1 so our final return T will be [1, 3].\nBy extending take, we can implement other functions like permutations.\nperm([], []).\nperm(L, [H | T]) :- take(L, H, R), perm(R, T).\n\nLet's permute [1, 2, 3] once again.\n?- perm([1, 2, 3], X).\n\nIt will not unify with the first rule, but it will with the second, obviously. The second clause will permute the list with the head taken away. Now, you might notice that H is not an explicit value here as when we used it earlier. Prolog seeing this will try to unify it with every value in the list, so take will be queried three times, with each value in the list being used in H. The resulting R from each of those queries is permuted again. The H used in take will be the head that is cons the backtracked form.\n[1, 2, 3] will become take([1, 2, 3], H, R). Prolog will run through every choice, starting with take([ 1,[1, 2, 3] R) which will unify R with [2, 3]. Now, the perm clause will be perm([2, 3], T). Let's assume that this gives all valid permutations of [2, 3] i.e. [2, 3] and [3, 2]. Well, the resulting match on the original X would be H | [2, 3] and H | [3, 2] or for this particular unification, [1, 2, 3] and [1, 3, 2]. This conclusively shows the inductive step, and the base case is trivially the empty list.\nAs you might be able to tell from these examples, there is a general strategy to solving problems in Prolog.\n\n\nGenerate a solution.\n\n\nTest if it is valid.\n\n\nIf not valid, backtrack and try another solution.\n\n\nQuicksort\nOne way to sort a list in Prolog is to use the generate and test method. You can generate all permutations of a list, and test whether each list is sorted. This is obviously incredibly inefficient with a Big O of \\(O(n!)\\).\npartition([], Y, [], []).\npartition([X|Xs], Y, {X|Ls], Rs) :- X =&lt; Y, partition(Xs, Y, Ls, Rs).\npartition([X|Xs], Y, Ls, [X|Rs]) :- X &gt; Y, partition(Xs, Y, Ls, Rs).\n\nquicksort([H | T], SL) :-\n    partition(T, H, Ls, Rs), quicksort(Ls, SLs), quicksort (Rs, SRs), append(SLs, [H|SRs], SL).\nquicksort([], []).\n\nThis quicksort method is a very declarative manifestation of how to do quicksort in plain English. Partition the list along the pivot, quicksort the left and right, then combine them.\n8-Queens\nOne classic problem in math is to find all of the arrangements of queens on a chessboard where none of the queens threaten each other. We will find it for 8 queens on an 8×8 chessboard.\nLet's cut down on our sample space, because there are a lot of permutations. If a queen is next to another, it obviously threatens it. In fact, because queens can never share the same row or column, that massively cuts our sample space. We can describe our solution as an array of eight values from one through eight, where the index of the value is the row of the queen and the value itself being its column. This way of describing the sample space not only cuts our sample space but makes our computation simpler. However, we have not checked the diagonals. That is what we need Prolog for.\ncheckBoard([H | T]) :- L is H - 1, R is H + 1, checkRow(T, L, R), checkBoard(T).\ncheckRow([H | T], L, R) :- H =\\= L, H =\\= R, LN is L - 1, RN is R + 1, checkRow(T, LN, RN)\ncheckBoard([]).\ncheckRow([], _, _).\n\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/prolog/","title":"Prolog"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/python-crash-course/":{"body":"Python is a powerful jack-of-all-trades language that is much less limited than OCaml.\nExpressions\nArithmetic works in a very simple and clear way in Python, basically like a calculator.\n2 # 2\n2 + 4 # 6\n(2 + 5) * (3 - 5) # -20\n\nUnlike in OCaml, operations can be performed between floats and integers with no issues; Python will simply change the types behind the scenes. This is called type coercion.\n2 + 3.5 # 5.5\n\nThis causes an interesting side effect: what is the return type of this function?\ndef add(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\nIn OCaml, the equivalent function would have type int -&gt; int -&gt; int, since the operation + is only valid for int. However, this function is actually polymorphic in Python! In OCaml, you would call it type 'a. In Python, this type is called Any, and operation changes based on what the types are. The reason that this is possible is because everything in Python is an object. Essentially, the variables a and b are just boxes that could contain anything, and Python only checks whether the operation + is defined for the two variables at runtime.\nStrings\nString manipulation is a very common operation in Python, so there are some very useful ways to handle strings built into the language.\n\"hello \" + \"world\" # \"hello world\"\n\"hello\" * 3 # \"hellohellohello\"\n\nYou can also convert types to strings very easily.\nstr(5) # \"5\"\nstr(3.5) # \"3.5\"\n\nAnd vice versa.\nint(\"5\") # 5\nfloat(\"3.5\") # 3.5\n\nThese are special built-in functions to make our lives earlier.\nVariables\nLike with OCaml, there is no need to specify types as in Java. Unlike OCaml, Python does not use type inference. Instead, every variable can contain any type in a box as mentioned earlier.\na = 3\nb = \"hello\"\n\nVariables in Python work differently under the hood than other languages. A variable is essentially just a name for an element.\nc = b\n\nc here is not just equal to b... it is actually b itself! And any change you make to b will reflect in c because of that. Actual copies must be explicit.\nSlices\nSlices are one of the most powerful tools in Python. In fact, it might be what Python is most known for and most useful for. Slicing allows for powerful manipulation of list-like data.\nOrdinary list access uses bracket notation with a single number to access a single element. Slice notation works similarly, but it allows returning multiple elements as a sub-list of the original list.\nx = \"hello world\"\nx[1:7] # \"ello w\"\n\nYou might notice that I just performed this operation on a string; didn't I just say that slices work on list-like types? In Python, strings are just fancy lists of chars!.\nTuples and Lists\nA tuple is an immutable set of multiple elements, just like in OCaml. Slicing operations work the same way in that they return a subsequence tuple. There's a weird side effect where if you slice in a way that returns a single element, you can get a single-element tuple.\nLists in Python are much more flexible in OCaml, as they can be heterogenous with any type within. They are also mutable, so elements of lists can be reassigned.\nSlicing can superpower this assignment by reassigning multiple values at once\nControl\nThe traditional if statements are back, but with a bit of a twist. Python has significant whitespace, which means that the amount that you indent by affects the actual execution of the code. This is quite rare.\nif x == 15:\n    y = 0 # this tab is mandatory!\nx = 3 # this line is outside the if block\n\nThere is a special keyword called pass which exists to allow empty blocks. Normally, this construct is forbidden:\nif x == 15:\nx = 3 # error!\n\nBut by using pass, this is possible:\nif x == 15:\n    pass # does nothing\nx = 3\n\nLike in C, boolean evaluation is 0 for false, true for everything else. However, you cannot assign a variable in a conditional! So this C construct would not be allowed:\nwhile ((int x = some_func()) == 0) {\n    // this is allowed in C\n}\n\nwhile (x = some_func()) == 0:\n    pass # this is not allowed in Python!\n\nFunctions\nFunctions are defined using the def keyword.\ndef fac(n):\n    if n &lt; 0:\n        return \"negative!\"\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * fac(n - 1)\n\nFunctional programming can be used similarly to OCaml where everything is a function.\ndef compose(f, g):\n    def foo(x):\n        return f(g(x))\n    return foo\n\nlet compose f g =\n    let foo x =\n        f g x\n    in foo x\n\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/python-crash-course/","title":"A Crash Course in Python"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/routers/":{"body":"Everyone nowadays gets the Internet through the router in their home. But what is a router?\nSpeed\nIt's likely that you have an internet speed in the tens of Mbps. This unit is megabits per second, or one million bits per second. Some routers in important locations have speeds in the Gbps, which is 1 billion bits per second. This is incredibly quick. How do routers accomplish this?\nStructure\nThe router is composed of a control plane and a data path. The control plane contains all the necessary external tooling to determine the paths. It contains routing protocols that need to be implemented, as well as a routing table. This table is used to look up all the possible paths to the destination and pick the shortest one.\nThis information is all stored on the data path, where each packet is actually processed. The routing table shortest path is put into the forwarding table which typically has a very small amount of SRAM in order to quickly mediate routing. You can think of it almost like a register that is close the process as opposed to the main memory where the calculations are made.\n\nRemember this distinction! The routing table contains all possible routes from this router, kind of like Google Maps. It needs to be a big table, so it is usually stored in slow, inexpensive DRAM. The forwarding table only contains the best possible route, so it is a small table stored in fast, expensive SRAM.\n\nRouters must also have input and output buffers. The input buffer is needed because the router may take in packets faster than it can process them, so it needs a place to put them before it can figure them out. The output buffer is needed because of the opposite problem; if the router processes the packets faster than the output link can output them, the packets need a place to be.\nForwarding Engine\nLet's examine the forwarding table in a little more detail. The forwarding table is a simple table that looks like this:\nDest-networkPort\n65.0.0.0/83\n128.9.0.0/161\n149.12.0.0/197\n\nIt is a simple path from networks, remembering which port to send packets.\nYou might have noticed that our destination networks are in prefix form. The one on port 7 has the longest prefix because it is matching the first 24 bits. We must match the longest prefix form first when looking for the network. These prefixes are the most specific and therefore must be matched before the smaller, more general prefixes. Prefixes can overlap, so we must pick the more specific one. It is typically not explicitly linear, a hash table-like structure is used to make lookups faster.\nIn fact, hierarchical addressing is important for allowing us to aggregate routes. Different organizations within the same ISP network will have some bits after the network bits devoted to differentiating between organizations. Let's imagine that Rutgers Newark and NJIT are on the same ISP network, but are different organizations, obviously. The first 19 bits of that prefix might be devoted to the ISP network, then the next 4 bits will be used for organizations within that network.\nSwitching Fabrics\nLet's consider each port as form of input and output. We will need a way to switch between devices. There are multiple ways to implement switching fabrics.\nOne way is through memory. This is the cheapest way of going about it. The I/O device will take the network and write it into memory. We can use DMA (Direct Memory Access) to do this more quickly. The header is processed, and the router checks the routing table for the best route. The packet must be copied from the port into memory, then processed, then loaded back into the output port. This is very slow. Most of the bottleneck is in the memory bus when copying memory. These routers are typically less than 10 Mbps.\nAnother way is through bus. The packet is transferred between input and output through a I/O bus, with a memory buffer to hold the packet on each end. There's no CPU movement here, it's all I/O instructions. But we still need some kind of command for the destination port number. The CPU will periodically calculate and cache the forwarding table on the input device (also known as line card). If there is a cache miss, then I/O will ask the CPU to update the cache from main memory, which is slow but doesn't happen often. However, since there's only one bus, there is only one communication possible between one port and another at a time. This speed is in the high Mbps.\nThe third way, which is the most high-end way, is the crossbar. It works like a bus, except that there exists a bus between every single port, which means that for \\(n\\) ports, we can have \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\) simultanenous transfers. This is in the best-case scenario where each input goes to a different output. However, if two ports are trying to connect to the same port, then one of them will be bottlenecked because it's still one bus. However, this complicated switching fabric is extremely expensive, which scales with the number of ports. The price can be worth it for a company like Google; their speeds can be in the Tbps!\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/routers/","title":"Routers"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/routing-algorithms/":{"body":"When a host needs to find the best destination/prefix to another host, what routing algorithm does it use? We can use either intra or inter domain.\nRouting and Forwarding\nAs you may recall, the routing table is a large DRAM table containing all possible paths and the forwarding table is a small SRAM table containing only the best possible path. The router also caches previous best paths so that they don't need to be retrieved for the same host over and over from DRAM.\nYou can visualize multiple routers in an undirected weighted graph. The weights matter so that a slow link will not be chosen even if the path is technically slower. By maintaining all paths, the router can pick a new best path if a link in the route crashes.\nBut how does the router actually update the forwarding table? There are several different algorithms we can use.\nLink State\nLink state is an intra-domain method that works fine for 50-100 routers, say on a university campus.\nLet's use the graph analogy again. It is often useful to abstract concepts in networking to graphs when thinking about algorithms, since we can apply well-known concepts from mathematics and algorithm design to the problem. There are multiple factors that play into the weight of each link, not just link speed, but routers assign their own holistic score to links for simplicity.\nThe obvious choice here is to use Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path, as it applies to undirected weighted graphs like the on we have just constructed. This algorithm generates the shortest path to every path up to and including the destination. It requires knowing all of the link speeds beforehand. This is accomplished through a link state broadcast i.e. pinging every router and checking the link speed of the ping. The algorithm is also iterative, which means the number of shortest destinations scales with iterations linearly. The time complexity of the algorithm is \\(Θ(|E| + |V| \\log |V|)\\).\nThis algorithm works best in a centralized graph like at a university. Instead of sending a link state broadcast every time a connection is made, each node in a graph will send its own link state to a centralized location, and that location will be checked for recomputation of shortest path.\nThe centralized node is the one that does all the calculations for shortest path. This is known as a distance vector. Each router must calculate its own distance on top of the other links to the node that it must pass by. Think of a table that is passed from link to link which is updated according to Dijkstra's algorithm. The initial distance vector table for a router only contains the link speeds for its adjacent routers, and all others are marked as infinity. Degenerate longer paths are thrown out when tables \"merge\" at a router.\nIf a link breaks, then the routers that have broken links get reset in the final table. When the broken router sends a new distance vector table, it updates the central table in the same process as the table generation.\nHowever, this doesn't work well when we have different domains in different autonomous systems controlled by different ISPs. We need some kind of inter-AS algorithm to manage this. However, as the intra-AS algorithms works well, we use federation in our algorithms. Inter-AS algorithms are used to route between ASes and intra-AS algorithms are then used within the AS.\nBGP\nThere are some barriers to inter-AS routing. We might not know whether the host is reachable, so we need to ask nearby ASes if they know. The protocol that these ASes use is BGP, the Border Gateway Protocol. With BGP, ASes can\n\n\nobtain subnet reachability information from neighboring ASes\n\n\npropagate reachability information to all the routers within the AS\n\n\nuse this information to calculate the best route to another subnet\n\n\nBGP works through persistent sessions between BGP routers over semi-permanent TCP connections. The sessions can be through any router, there doesn't need to be a physical link. The two peers can communicate regardless of the physical router.  This is the sequence of steps:\n\n\nEstablish TCP over port 179.\n\n\nExchange routing tables. At first, this is a lot of data, but after a connection is established only deltas (like Git) need to be exchanged.\n\n\nSend four kinds of messages.\n\n\n\n\nOpen - establish session by exchanging AS numbers and the BGP identifier (arbitrary router IP address). There is a timer for how long to wait before just assuming the session is down i.e. in an outage.\n\n\nNotification - report unusual conditions, usually an error. If there are header errors, or a timer has expired, etc. then the TCP session must be terminated.\n\n\nUpdate - inform if there are new active or old inactive routers. The message includes the withdrawn routes, which are inactive routers, the length of that field as it can be variable, etc.\n\n\nKeepalive - regular message that the session is alive. BGP needs this regular message otherwise the neighbor AS won't know whether you're alive or not.\n\n\nWhen we say that a router is advertising a prefix, there are some necessary assumptions. The routing information must be valid, and does not need to be refreshed until necessary. The path that an AS advertises to a node is the same path that AS uses to communicate with that node.\nThe BGP protocol additionally has many attributes that indicate the characteristics of a prefix:\n\n\nORIGIN: advertises the origin of an announcement and prefix injection. This is manually configured by intra-routing protocols.\n\n\nAS_PATH: a link of ASes which is the path of ASes that the prefix has traveled to. This is useful for detecting loops and selecting shorter routes of ASes.\n\n\nNEXT_HOP: the hop field is when you cross the AS boundary. After you cross, the next hop value is the next AS you need to get to in order to get to the destination router. The reason this is important is because the IP packets within an AS can travel in any order irrespective of BGP, so the intra-routing algorithm can decide where to go based on this value. This becomes significant when a network experiences transit traffic and different networks are using that network as an intermediary. In order to get the packet to exit the network as quickly as possible, BGP can make the decision to send the packet through non-BGP routers if it's a faster way to make the packet leave the network.\n\n\nMED: stands for Multi-Exit Discriminator. If ASes are connected via multiple links, the AS that receives a prefix uses this value to discriminate between exits, with a lower value being better.\n\n\nLOCAL_PREF: indicates a local preference for a specific prefix, is a number that is more for more preference, by default 100. For example, if outbound traffic is preferred to be a specific exit point, then that point will have high local preference. It can be used to break a tie between routers.\n\n\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/routing-algorithms/","title":"Routing Algorithms"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/schedulers/":{"body":"The way that the operating system decides which processes to run and when is a complicated process known as scheduling. This is how it works.\n\nWe should understand a few vocabulary words before we discuss schedulers in detail.\n\n\njob: an execution stream for a certain amount of time (not the same as process!)\n\n\nworkload: the jobs that must be executed\n\n\nlatency: time taken for one operation\n\n\nthroughput: number of total operations\n\n\nMetrics\nWe can design schedulers that are designed to minimize certain metrics. No scheduler is perfect at everything, so we need to prioritize what metrics matter.\n\n\nturnaround time: how long does the job take to complete?\n\n\\( completionTime - arrivalTime \\)\n\n\n\nresponse time: how long does the job take to start? e.g. game keystrokes\n\n\\( scheduleTime - arrivalTime \\)\n\n\n\nwaiting time: how long does the job wait in the ready queue?\n\nsame as response except when killing procs\n\n\n\nthroughput: jobs completed per unit time\n\n\nresource utilization: manage small resources well e.g. battery\n\n\noverhead: how strenuous is the scheduler itself?\n\n\nfairness: how well is CPU time shared between jobs?\n\n\nFIFO\nFIFO stands for First In, First Out, which is a fairly self-explanatory title. A FIFO scheduler does jobs in the order that they arrive. This kind of scheduler is trivial to implement. However, we can run into issues if say, the first job takes a long time to complete. The other jobs that would complete much quicker are waiting even though it would be better if we could just get those out of the way first.\nSJF\nSJF stands for Shortest Job First, which again is self-explanatory. This is better than FIFO, but relies on the OS having oracle-like knowledge of all the jobs that will come, since a shorter job could come later that the scheduler can't factor into its calculations.\nThese schedulers only work when you have access to all the jobs at once, which is almost never the case in real-world workloads. We need to use some kind of preemptive scheduling which will switch and split jobs as necessary.\nSTCF\nSTCF stands for Shortest To Completion First. It is similar to SJF, but it recalculates the job closest to completion every time a new job arrives. This way, if a super short job arrives while a long job is executing, STCF can switch to it and complete it quickly before finishing the long job, which improves completion time. This expands the machinery needed in the scheduler but has much better outcomes.\nRR\nRR stands for Round Robin. This approach is fairly different than the the previous two schedulers because it does not make any attempt to optimize for the shortest time. Instead, RR optimizes for fairness by executing every single job on the same exact time intervals. So it will run 10 ms of Job A, then 10 ms of Job B, then 10 ms of Job C, etc. in the fairest way possible regardless of the actual length of those jobs.\nPreemptive scheduling is pretty cool, but we're still treating all our jobs like they're the same. If we introduce the notion of priority in jobs then we can use it for real-time jobs.\nMLFQ\nMLFQ stands for Multi-Level Feedback Queue. The implementation is similar to RR but it works on multiple priority levels. There are two job types: interactive and batch. Interactive processes are those like games and text editors that need immediate response and therefore low response time. Batch processes are those like daemons that are lower priority and care more about general turnaround time than response time.\nFor our implementation, we have multiple priority queues:\nif a.priority &gt; b.priority {\n    a.run();\n} else if a.priority == b.priority {\n    rr(a, b);\n}\n\nMLFQ prioritizes nice processes. This is a technical term that means that a process is satistfied with getting a response and is willing to turn over the CPU as needed without the OS needing to force it to.\nAll jobs begin by having top priority, but if a job takes too long on the RR, then you demote it to a lower priority level. This way, smaller jobs that are contained within RR are executed quickly at top priority.\nHowever, this system is incredibly easy to game. Processes control the jobs that they send to the CPU so you can split up jobs exactly aligned to RR to execute all the jobs at top priority even though you don't actually need it.\nLottery\nThe lottery system is fairer, just like a real lottery. Every process gets a certain amount of lottery tickets associated with it, scaling with priority. Whichever process wins the lottery gets to run its job. This way, higher priority jobs have a higher probability of running than lower priority jobs, but it's protected against gaming the system. The number of tickets that a process gets represents its CPU usage.\nint counter = 0;\nint winner = getrandom(0, total_tickets);\nnode_t *curr = head;\nwhile curr {\n    counter += curr-&gt;tickets;\n    if (counter &gt; winner) {\n        break;\n    }\n    curr = curr-&gt;next;\n}\n\nMultiprocessing\nEvery scheduler we've discussed so far assumes only a single CPU can execute jobs, which was true for a long time. Now, however, multicore CPUs are becoming increasingly common in consumer electronics. How do we schedule jobs among different CPUs?\nCache affinity and coherence can become issues. CPUs have a cache located next to them different from main memory where commonly used memory is stored in order to speed up operations. Every core has its own caches, so what happens when multiple cores execute the same stream? They have to have cache coherence so that we don't end up with bugs. The way to fix this is to copy caches between cores.\nObviously, this is pretty inefficient. We want to avoid this as much as possible by having each process run on its own CPU thread as much as possible; this is cache affinity. Basic FIFO scheduling is simple but is not good at preserving affinity. Having a scheduler that preserves affinity at the cost of some other inefficiencies can actually cause massive speedups because of the importance of cache affinity. However, this machinery can be complex.\nCFS\nThe Completely Fair Scheduler is the scheduler that Linux actually uses. Instead of using time-slices to manage job usage, the scheduler assigns processes a proportion of the CPU. The fairness is absolute because each thread gets an absolute amount of CPU running. This also fixes multiprocessing issues because the scheduler is based around CPU cores instead of time. However, the switching rate might change a lot because we are no longer looking at time, and as we discussed context switching has its own costs that we might want to minimize. This is a tradeoff made for fairness.\nI mentioned niceness earlier. CFS uses a more complex version of niceness which ranges from -20 to 19, with the default of 0, and higher values being worse. There is also a separate priority called real-time priority ranging from 0 - 99 which always execute before nice processes, regardless of how nice they are.\nIn order to calculate RR, we take the target latency e.g. 20 ms and split the time across the tasks equally among process of the same priority. However, because this is based around CPU and not constant time, this can be extremely fast. A tree data structure is used for priority in order to quickly get the highest priority and least time jobs.\nTarget Latency is the minimum amount of time required to get a task at least one turn on the processor. Within this window, every process gets some CPU. Minimum Granularity imposes small unfairness in CFS. There is a floor on the timeslice of 1 ms regardless of how much CPU we have. This means that for a large amount of jobs, smaller jobs get unfairly good treatment.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/schedulers/","title":"Scheduling"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/smtp/":{"body":"Email is the most popular way in the world to send large messages. This is a complicated process which requires its own protocol: SMTP.\nSMTP\nThe Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is how user agents communicate with mail servers. On a high level, email works similarly to physical mail. The mail server is like a post office with mailboxes for each user agent. When a person wants to send a message, they put the envelope in their own mailbox. The mailman user agent then takes the envelope to the post office and puts it in their server mailbox. When a person wants to retrieve a message, their mailman gets all the mail in their post office mailbox and delivers it to the person's personal mailbox. The SMTP post office workers at the server are responsible for moving the mail between mailboxes.\nTo continue the post office analogy, we can imagine an email being sent between Alice and Bob. Alice lives in Hong Kong and Bob lives in San Juan, so they have different post offices. The workers at the Hong Kong post office see that there is an envelope in Alice's message queue addressed to Hong Kong. They open a TCP connection as the client to the San Juan server and sends the envelope to the San Juan post office. The workers at San Juan now have an envelope, and they see that it is addressed to Bob. They then place the envelope in Bob's mailbox. When Bob wants to check his email, he sends his mailman over to the post office, who returns with the email from Alice.\nLet's examine the TCP connection a little more closely. The connection is established on port 25, which is reserved for SMTP. It does some handshaking on the application layer in order to establish the email addresses of the sender and the recipient. The simple exchange goes like this:\n\n\nserver sends 220 with hostname, client responds with HELO and its own hostname\n\n\nserver confirms 250 that it's ok\n\n\nclient tells server MAIL FROM and RCPT TO addresses and the server confirms each with 250\n\n\nclient sends DATA and server confirms with 354 that it's ready to receive mail\n\n\nthe client sends the entirety of the message, ending with a lone period to finish the message, which the server confirms with 250\n\n\nthe client can repeat steps 3-5 for any additional messages, then sends QUIT for a server 221 response that closes the connection\n\n\nvs. HTTP\nBoth HTTP and SMTP are protocols that transfer files between clients and servers, so there are natural parallels. However, there are also significant differences.\nThere is a difference in who initiates the connection which defines the two. In HTTP, the requesting client initiates the connection, making it a pull protocol; you can think of the client \"pulling\" the data from the server. In SMTP, it is the sending client that initiates the connection, making it a push protocol where the client \"pushes\" the data to the other server.\nSMTP also has many restrictions. The message can only be in ASCII, so any data that is sent over that is not in ASCII, like multimedia, must be encoded and decoded. HTTP allows any data to be transferred. A result of this is that HTTP data of different types like multimedia must be in its own response message, while SMTP objects are all in the same ASCII message.\nThere is some peripheral data that SMTP messages can include in a header, just like HTTP, such as the sender, receiver, and the subject of the email. These are different from commands; this data is part of the actual email, not the protocol!\nMail Access\nThere's a part of the post office analogy that has been ignored so far. How exactly does the mailman get to the post office? After all, this is another client-server connection, so there must also be a protocol that defines this interaction. We can use SMTP for the mailman delivering the envelope, as this is the same kind of \"push\" that the post office uses to send to the other post office. But this introduces an issue for the person on the other end; if the mailman can only push mail it already has to somewhere else, then how does Bob's mailman get the mail on the server? There are many protocols that can define this interaction, such as POP3, IMAP, and HTTP.\nIn 2022, HTTP is the obvious choice for this exchange. After all, everyone accesses email through their web browser, which is making HTTP requests anyway. Why not just use an HTTP request to get the mail from the mail server? And as you might expect, almost every email provider today, from Gmail to Hotmail to Yahoo Mail uses Web-based email.\nHowever, back when \"user agent\" and \"web browser\" weren't synonymous, people had applications dedicated to accessing email that couldn't access the web or use HTTP. In those times, Post Office Protocol—Version 3 and Internet Mail Access Protocol were used.\nPOP3 is a simple and therefore limited protocol. It operates over port 110 and has three steps: authorization, transaction, and update. The post office first authenticates the mailman by asking him for a username and password before he can check your mailbox. Then, the mailman retrieves the envelope from the post office. While the mailman is at the post office, they can also do some operations like marking emails for deletion and getting statistics for your account. When the mailman leaves the post office, the workers throw away all the mail that the mailman marked for deletion.\nIt's common for users to want to organize emails through folders like Inbox, Junk, etc. This is of course possible through user agent, but POP3 does not allow for this organization in your post office mailbox. IMAP provides this as well as many more features. It is stateful so that the user can keep the folders that it creates at the mailbox. One more important feature is its ability to lazily fetch emails from the mailbox, so the user's entire inbox is not just sent immediately. Imagine if you had to download every email in your inbox in order to access it! I know my connection wouldn't be able to handle my 1k+ unread emails.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/smtp/","title":"SMTP Explained"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/special-relativity/":{"body":"Albert Einstein revolutionized the world of physics when he discovered the special theory of relativity. It is only possible due to his contributions that valuable technologies like GPS function. But what is it exactly?\nDilation and Contraction\nThe theory behind special relativity is two-fold:\n\n\nAll inertial frames of reference of equivalent.\n\n\nObservers must measure the same value for the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\n\nThis means that if even an observer has a huge difference in relative velocity, the speed of light is the same. This causes knock-on effects on the experience of time, and time dilation:\n$$\nΔt = \\frac{Δt_0}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n$$\nThe proper time \\(Δt_0\\) is the time interval with respect to an observer at rest. The dilated time is the time when the observer is at velocity \\(v\\).\nIn the same way that time can be dilated, length can also be contracted:\n$$\nL = L_0\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\n$$\nThe relationship here is inverse! Time can only be dilated, and length can only be contracted. If the velocity was the speed of light (impossible) then the time interval would be infinite, and the length of an object would be 0.\nRelativistic Addition\nTwo objects traveling at different relativistic velocities further complicate these calculations. If we want to calculate the proper velocity \\(u\\) of an object from its relativistic velocity \\(u'\\) relative to an object at proper velocity \\(v\\) or vice versa, then we can use these equations:\n$$\nu = \\frac{u' + v}{1 + \\frac{vu'}{c^2}}\n$$\n$$\nu' = \\frac{u - v}{1 - \\frac{vu}{c^2}}\n$$\nAs you can see, these are very similar equations, but their differences are important.\nMass and Energy\nIt's the moment you've been waiting for, the famous equation!\n$$\nE = \\frac{m_0c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n$$\nOh, it looks a little bit different. That's because just like length and time are relativistic, mass is as well. In order to calculate total energy from rest mass, we must apply the same expression to it. There's another way to calculate \\(E\\):\n$$\nE = KE + E_0\n$$\nwhere \\(E_0\\) comes from the classic \\(E = mc^2\\) equation. We can also find the kinetic energy by rearranging these equations as\n$$\nKE = (m - m_0)c^2\n$$\nfrom finding the difference between relativistic mass and proper mass.\nOne more important attribute affected by relativity is momentum. As it depends on mass, it looks similar to the equation for \\(E\\):\n$$\np = \\frac{m_0v}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n$$\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/special-relativity/","title":"Special Relativity"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/swapping/":{"body":"Sometimes we don't have a lot of memory to access. In those cases, we need a place to put our data. The natural solution is to put data in the disk, which has very high storage. This is known as swapping.\nMechanism\nThe actual process of copying memory to disks is not complicated, it is simply file I/O and is supported by hardware. We swap memory out to disk, and swap in data from disk to memory. The complicated part comes when we introduce paging to this idea.\nIn order to accommodate this, we add a present bit to our page table entry. If the bit is 0, then the page has been swapped out to disk and the physical frame is no longer valid. When there is an attempted translation of a page table entry with an unset present bit, a trap will occur and the hardware will swap in memory from the disk, setting the present bit with a new translation for the new physical frame number.\nAn important note is that a process will never directly access the disk! Instead, a trap will swap disk and memory and the process will access the memory as dictated by hardware and the OS.\nAMAT\nSwapping can be slow. We want to improve our Average Memory Access Time (AMAT). A hit in this context is an access that goes directly to RAM, and a miss is a trap that will get the memory from disk into RAM.\n$$AMAT = (Hit \\% \\cdot T_m) + (Miss \\% \\cdot T_d)$$\nPolicies\nWhen we swap in and out of memory, we need a way to find the most frequently accessed pages to reduce AMAT. There are several policies to accomplish this.\nThe optimal policy which has oracular knowledge of future page accesses can keep pages that will be accessed sooner and replace pages that will be accessed later. If we know that a page will be required soon, we're definitely not going to swap it out. Alternatively, if we know that it's going to be a while before the page is going to be accessed, we can swap it out, improving our AMAT. This is obviously infeasible when page access is random, which is almost all the time.\nThe simplest possible policy is, as with schedulers, FIFO. However, this does not work well. A better, also simple policy is LRU, or Least Recently Used. Most caches of this kind use LRU because of how effective it is despite its simplicity. The idea can be expressed in one line: swap out the page which has been least recently accessed. By keeping the pages of physical memory in a queue when they are created, it's simple to dequeue and swap out the page for a new, freshly enqueued page. The counter is reset every time that a page is swapped out.\nLRU adds more memory usage in order to maintain the queue\n\nYou would think that having more pages reduces the number of page misses. However, due to Belady's Anomaly, this is not always the case for FIFO. LRU does not suffer from this phenomenon\n\nHowever, LRU does not take into consideration how many times a page has been accessed. A large I/O scan that is only used once might flush memory because it is recent without regard to how often it is used. When you stream a movie, you are sequentially accessing that data. This is a common access pattern in computer science.\nWe can use pure LFU, or Least Frequently Used to combat this. However, this runs into the opposite problem: what if a page was very frequently accessed in the past? The policy will not forget that so it won't be evicted despite it being very old.\nA better approach is to combine both of the ideas of recency and frequency, through algorithms such as LRU-K or 2Q. However, these algorithms can be expensive due to their increased complexity compared to these other simpler algorithms.\nImplementing LRU\nThere are two approaches: software and hardware, as always.\nA software based LRU will be a sorted linked list. Accessing a linked list is slow, which means \\(O(n)\\) complexity for a memory reference, although replacing pages is very fast at \\(O(1)\\).\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/swapping/","title":"Swapping"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/tail-recursion/":{"body":"Recursion in many languages can cause significant overhead. It might seem that the excess amount of recursion in OCaml would decrease its performance. But it actually doesn't, and that's thanks to tail recursion.\nImplementing Reverse\nIn a functional language with a linked list, it's not a trivial task to reverse a list. There are multiple ways to do it, and they have different performance implications.\nThe most basic implementation would just be to concatenate backwards.\nlet rec rev l =\n    match l with\n    | [] -&gt; []\n    | x :: xs -&gt; (rev xs) @ [x]\n\nUnfortunately, there's a problem with this. Every time we call rev recursively, we must initialize a new stack frame for every recursive call, leaving the value x in [x] in the calling stack.\nrev [1; 2; 3]\n → (rev [2; 3]) @ [1]\n → ((rev [3]) @ [2]) @ [1]\n → (((rev []) @ [3]) @ [2]) @ [1]\n → (([] @ [3]) @ [2]) @ [1]\n → ([3] @ [2]) @ [1]\n → [3; 2] @ [1]\n → [3; 2; 1]\n\nAs you can see, there are a total of three stack frames for a list with three elements. This is pretty bad. However, we can rewrite this function to use tail recursion.\nlet rec rev_helper l acc =\n    match l with\n    | [] -&gt; acc\n    | x :: xs -&gt; rev_helper xs (x :: acc)\nlet rev l = rev_helper l []\n\nThere doesn't need to be any stack frame here because there are no local variables. The only thing that's being returned is the function call to rev_helper, so the stack can simply change to the rev_helper call without saving the previous stack frame. This tail recursion is incredibly powerful.\nI'll repeat it to be clear. Tail recursion works when the return value of a recursive function is only the recursive function call. The reason that the previous rev function didn't work is because the return value was (rev xs) @ [x], so x must be saved in a stack frame in order to remember it.\nHowever, you might have noticed that we had to include a new variable called acc. This accumulator variable is a common pattern for when we want to have tail recursion since the acc is located inside the function call as an argument.\nThe power of tail recursion can not be understated here. In a typical function, having excessive stack frames can easily cause a stack overflow for a large data set. With tail recursion, we can have both the lack of side effects associated with recursion and the performance associated with iteration.\nGeneral Tail Recursion Pattern\nlet f x =\n    let rec aux arg acc =\n        if (* base case *) then acc\n        else\n            let arg' = (* next argument *)\n            let acc' = (* updated accumulator *)\n            aux arg' acc' in\n    aux x (* initial value of accumulator e.g. 0, []*)\n\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/tail-recursion/","title":"Tail Recursion in OCaml"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/tcp/":{"body":"TCP is the well-known protocol for reliable transfer of data. But how does it actually work?\n\nSystem of handshakes ensures reliable transmission of data.\n\n\nWhat happens if a packet is corrupted, and its bits are flipped?\n\nUse a checksum for each packet.\n\n\n\nWhat happens if a packet is lost somewhere?\n\nWait for acknowledgement from receiver, and if not received, resend.\n\n\n\nWhat happens if a packet is duplicated? etc. etc.\n\n\nThere are lots of problems that can happen with UDP. Let's create a protocol that doesn't have this unreliability.\nOur new protocol has a sequence number for each packet, either 0 or 1. This is known as an alternating bit protocol. When it sends a packet, it waits for ACK (acknowledgment) before it sends the next packet. This will take one RTT (round trip transmission) per packet. This is obviously pretty inefficient, but it does solve at least some of these issues. It solves the duplicate issue because if it sends the same packet, it will have the same bit sequence number and hterefore will not be taken into account. You can think of this as an infinite loop which flips its break condition after being broken. This is possible because you're only sending one packet at a time. Here is time and utilization.\n$$ T_{transmit} = \\frac{L_{packetLength}}{R_{transmissionRate}} $$\n$$ U_{sender} = \\frac{\\frac{L}{R}}{RTT - \\frac{L}{R}} $$\nIf we can send W packets at aa time, then we can replace $\\frac{L}{R}$ with \\(W\\), which will improve our time by a factor of \\(W\\)! However, if we send a stream of packets, then there are more issues. If you send a receiver too much data, then it will throw out the data it cannot receive. If packets get lost somewhere in the router, you will have no idea. Stopping the stream to check for issues wastes a lot of time.\nWe can solve this using a window time. We send packets up until the first ACK is received, then we check for any problems with ACK. But what is the window size?\n$$ B \\cdot RTT = W \\cdot packetSize $$\nThis way we can pipeline as many packets as are possible before anything can go wrong. This increases the complexity on the recv side, but keeps the connection simple and reliable. Let's say the window size is 3. We can send 3 packets, then we must wait for ACK for the first packet. When the ACK is received for packet p, we send packet p + 3. If the timer expires, we have to resend the packet. We can make the assumption that everything to the left of the window has been ACKed, and everything to the right of the window has not yet been sent.\nWhat is the efficiency of this new method?\n$$ U_{sender} = \\frac{3 \\cdot \\frac{L}{R}}{RTT \\cdot \\frac{L}{R}} $$\nThis is an increase of a factor of 3!\nBut what if a packet is dropped and sent later? This is where the receiver comes in. There are two ways of dealing with this:\n\n\nGo back N: simple, keep a buffer of 1 and throw out data with greater sequence numbers and ACK at that packet that was received. This will force the sender to resend all of the packets thata re now timed out. However, this also throws out correctly received packets.\n\n\nSelective Repeat: complex, keep a buffer proportional to W and keep data that has been received, cancelling the timers for each. Once the data has been correctly received, you can move the window and keep the buffer open for anything that hasn't been received. Let's say packet 1 is timed out but 2 and 3 came in correctly. We can cancel those two timers and slide the window to 4 and 5 but still wait for 1. There are only ever W packets in transmission at any given point!\n\n\nIn order to demonstrate the benefits of selective repeat over go back N, we'll work though an example. Say we are sending 5 packets of size 100 B each over a 100 MB/s link with a RTT of 100 ms, with packet timeout being send_time + RTT and the window buffer being of size 5. How long would it take to receive all of the packets if we drop the third packet?\nThe send_time here is 100 B / 100 MB/s or 0.001 ms. The time to receive a packet is half of RTT or 50 ms. The timeout length is 100.001 ms.\nWith go back N, packets 1 and 2 are received at times 50.001 ms and 50.002 ms. All good! But when the third packet is dropped, we must wait 100.01 ms to receive it again at 150.003 ms. Even though we received packets 4 and 5 already at 50.004 ms and 50.005 ms, we had to throw them out because we didn't get packet 3. We resend them as soon as possible after packet 3 so they are received at 150.004 ms and 150.005 ms respectively. The whole transaction takes 150.005 ms.\nWith selective repeat, the four non-dropped packets are received in the same way. However, after packet 3 times out and is resent, it is the only packet that is sent at 150.003 ms, since every other packet was within our window. The whole transaction here will take 150.003 ms.\nThe protocol we have just created is known as TCP.\n\n\nconnection management\n\n\nretransmission\n\n\nflow control\n\n\ncongestion control\n\n\nframe format\n\n\nIt has it all!\nTCP is the default protocol for every web browser in existence and is the de facto protocol for reliable transmission. Chrome now also uses QUIC which is a Google-created protocol but the vast majority of Internet traffic is still TCP.\nTCP Header\nThe TCP header is much more complex than the UDP header. It includes some of the same elements, such as the port numbers and the checksum, and others:\n\n\n32-bit sequence number and acknowledgement number, which are used for reliability\n\n\n16-bit receive window for flow control so that the bytes sent do not overwhelm the receiver\n\n\n4-bit header length field to indicate the length of the header, needed because of variable options, but usually 20\n\n\nvariable options field needed when specific maximum segment size (MSS) is needed or other options for high-speed networks\n\n\n6-bit flag field: ACK for a segment that is an acknowledgement; RST, SYN, and FIN for connections, PSH for immediate network sending, and URG to indicate some urgent data is located at the location where the 16-bit urgent data pointer points (these last three are typically unused)\n\n\nThe sequence and acknowledgment numbers are how TCP messages are ordered despite being sent in a full-duplex way. The sequence number orders the segments for reconstruction into a full message, and the acknowledgment number is a way of communicating the next byte that the sender needs. This way, if a segment is dropped, the sender of the dropped segment knows that the receiver didn't get it because they're still waiting on it in the acknowledgement number.\nRTT\nRound-trip time is an important concept when we consider making our protocol as fast as possible. This is how long it takes for a segment to be sent and an acknowledgment for that segment to be recieved. In order to get an accurate measure of the RTT, TCP takes the current RTT and refines it to an average as more segments are transmitted, since any one SampleRTT (SRTT) might be an outlier. In order to get the average EstimatedRTT we follow this formula:\n$$ERTT = (1 - α) \\cdot ERTT + α \\cdot SRTT$$\n\\(α\\) in this formula is typically 0.125. This means that average is weighted towards recent samples, since they better reflect the current weight.\nWe should also have a measure of variance in RTT, since averages can be deceiving. DevRTT is the measure of the variance, which is calculated like this:\n$$DevRTT = (1 - β) \\cdot DevRTT + β \\cdot | SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT |$$\nLike ERTT, DRTT moves and is weighted recently, with a \\(β\\) value of usually 0.25.\nThe reason this is important is because the interval at which a TCP segment transmission times out is based on RTT. TCP calculates this way:\n$$TimeoutInterval = ERTT + 4 \\cdot DRTT$$\nThis starts out as one second, then changes over time. Timeouts cause this value to double because a new link may be chosen that has a longer RTT than what ERTT has estimated so far.\nCongestion Control\nA network is said to be congested when so much traffic is being sent through the network that many packets become lost. To combat this, TCP implements congestion control.\nEvery sender has a limited rate at which it can send traffic into its connection based on the way TCP thinks the network is congested. If it thinks it's not very congested, then it increases the send rate, and vice versa. There are three elements to this implementation: how to limit the rate, how to perceive the congestion, and how mathematically the rate should be limited.\nThe mechanism at the sender keeps track of a congestion window, also known as cwnd. The amount of unacknowledged data that a sender sends must not be greater than either the congestion window or the receive window.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/tcp/","title":"TCP Explained"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/threads/":{"body":"Concurrency is a powerful tool to increase performance in applications. This is usually accomplished using threads.\nMotivation\nClock frequency in CPUs has massively increased over the past few decades, growing at an exponential rate from the tens of MHz to GHz. However, circa 2005, clock frequency began to stagnate, and for the past decade the clock frequency of consumer CPUs have not increased past around 4 GHz. Why is that?\nClock frequency is typically increased by increasing the number of transistors in a single CPU. This can be done either by increasing the size of the CPU, or decreasing the size of the transistors. Because we don't want huge CPUs in our computers emitting tons of heat, we have opted to decrease the size of transistors. However, there is a limit to how small they can go. When a transistor starts getting smaller than 30 nm, power leakage will begin to affect the CPU, causing the same heat problems that a big CPU does.\nIn order to keep up with computing trends, new CPUs have multiple CPU cores with the same transistor density. However, utilizing multiple CPU cores requires parallelism in the CPU. An ideal CPU might run one process on each core, with each process getting full control over the CPU.\nYou can visualize this idea like a highway. Having multiple lanes allows cars to travel much faster than if there is only one lane. However, there can be issues when the lanes must combine, like in merging. This causes traffic like if there was only one lane, and can actually increase overhead as cars attempt to merge. Decreasing the amount of merging (or synchronization) is key to fast concurrency.\nThreads\nWe have discussed processes before; threads are not much different. They contain information about an execution such as the register values, open file streams, etc., but are more lightweight than processes. \nThere are multiple frameworks for threading that are useful for different workflows. The producer/consumer model is typically used for data analysis. Multiple threads create some data which is handled by a synchronizing consumer thread. The pipeline model works like a real pipeline, where multiple threads are consumed in steps and pipeline flows. This is common in GPU programming. The background model will work similarly to the interactive/batch model in MLFQ. Background threads do behind-the-scenes dirty work when the CPU is idle, and foreground threads will run the actual important parts of a process.\nSince threads exist within a single process, they share the same address space, including the stack and the heap. This can cause many, many bugs when it comes to accessing and modifying memory. We will discuss methods to solve these bugs later.\nThreads do not share the same instruction pointer, however. Each thread can execute from different parts of the program. All register values are unique to each thread, as they can execute on any CPU.\nThreads can technically share the same stack on the address space. However, this is pretty obviously a bad idea. Typically, threads will create their own stack so that each thread does not interfere with each other's local variables and execution, with their own stack pointer %esp to point to their stack.\nOS Support\nIt's all well and good to have threads, but we need a way for the OS to know how we're switching between threads. There are multiple ways to do this.\nUserspace threads are a way to have concurrency regardless of what the OS thinks. A run-time will execute along with your program and swap between threads itself without the OS knowing. This is how pthread works, and also how Project 2 does. However, the power that concurrency grants for multicore CPUs is still dependent on the number of kernel threads generated, because those are the only ones that run on each CPU.\nKernel threads can be associated one-to-one with user-level threads. This way, threads can take advantage of multiprocessing because the kernel will parallelize operations across CPUs. However, this incurs an overhead for the syscalls needed to parallelize threads, and there will never be enough kernel threads for the user threads.\nScheduling\nSmall operations like incrementing a variable can be difficult when we have threads accessing the same data. The simple instruction balance++ where balance is stored at memory location 0x9cd4 would have this assembly output:\n0x195    mov 0x9cd4, %eax\n0x19a    add $0x1, %eax\n0x19d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mov %eax, 0x9cd4\n\nIf we have a context switch when %eip is at 0x19a, the first thread will add but not store the new value back in memory. That means that the variable balance would be less than expected because the add by the first thread would not be stored into memory.\nThis can lead to non-determinism, where the same input will cause different outputs, as well as race conditions, where the result of a program will depend on the CPU timing of different operations.\nWe want these three instructions to be executed uninterrupted. This is known as atomicity. In this critical section, no process or thread can interrupt the currently executing thread. However, if we allow programs to do this, then they can take advantage of this property and essentially disable the timer for context switches by declaring the entirety of execution atomic. We can't have full blocking on interrupts for threads, so we only lock other threads from executing at the critical section. When the timer interrupt hits, the scheduler will still take control, but no other thread will be able to execute at the critical section.\nSynchronization Primitives\nThere are many high-level synchronization primitives in the OS that exist to ensure the correct order of instructions. Each kind of lock is designed to solve a specific problem; no single lock can solve all of them.\nWe want to have correctness in our concurrency. This means that we must have mutual exclusion where only one thread can access the critical section at a time. If multiple threads are waiting for something, they cannot be stuck forever, they must make progress. Similarly, threads cannot be forced to wait an unreasonably large amount of time. Concurrency must also be fair and not favor any thread over any thread. And obviously, we do not want to overly tax the CPU with the overhead of synchronization.\nWe need underlying hardware atomic operations in order to implement synchronization. When these hardware instructions execute, no instruction or interrupt can execute. Example instructions are Test&amp;Set and Compare&amp;Swap.\nThe reason we need this is because if we don't make these instructions atomic, we can encounter race conditions. Imagine an unset lock with a while loop and two threads. The first thread successfully enters the loop because the lock is unacquired. However, before it can acquire the lock, the thread switches and the second thread executes and acquires the lock. Now the first thread has not acquired the lock but it is still in the loop, so when it runs again it will acquire the lock even though it has already been acquired, allowing two threads in the same critical section! In order to combat this, testing and setting are the same atomic operation so there isn't a gap that can allow a switch in between those two operations.\nSpinlocks\nMaking our implementation fair is not as easy. If we imagine the most basic spinlock which switches back and forth, a program that knows how long a context switch will take will acquire the lock right before every context switch so no other program will be obtain it.\nIn order to introduce fairness, the ticket system for schedulers can be used here. Every thread is assigned a ticket for every turn it gets, with the first thread getting ticket 1, second ticket 2, etc. Now when a thread releases a lock, the ticket increments to the next thread. Even if it wants to maliciously acquire the lock before a context switch occurs, it can't because it has lost its turn.\nWe need a special atomic function to make this work like Test&amp;Set with basic mutex. We should be able to get a ticket number and increment it atomically. The function used for this is Fetch&amp;Add.\nint FetchAndAdd(int *ptr) {\n    int old = *ptr; // these two lines are\n    *ptr = old + 1; // executed atomically!\n    return old;\n}\n\nSpinlocks are fast when we have a short critical section because we're not context switching very often, so when we switch between locks constantly we want to avoid that overhead as much as possible as that dominates execution time. However, in a situation where there is only one CPU, letting the threads spin on a lock is extremely wasteful. The CPU scheduler has no idea that a thread is waiting for a lock so it will ignorantly run it even though all it does is spin.\nOne alternative is to yield the thread instead of letting it spin, telling the CPU scheduler that the thread doesn't need to run right now. In general, a shorter critical section is okay to spin, but a longer critical section is not okay to spin.\nCondition Variables\nMutex locks are just a way of restricting access to a critical section. It's synchronous, but there's no order to the way that the threads have to run. That is up to the caprices of the scheduler. However, let's say that ordering is significant to the execution of our threads. How can we ensure that threads are executed in a certain order?\nWe need some functions and concepts to implement this. There are two system call functions wait(cond_t, mutex_t) and signal(cond_t) that are used with condition variables cond_t.\nLet's assume that a thread has acquired the lock, but it has not satisfied the condition to run yet because another thread must run first to preserve ordering. In that case, the condition variable will indicate that the thread cannot run and it will call wait to sleep the thread until the condition variable changes, releasing the lock so that the other thread can run. The caller of signal wants to wake up that sleeping thread, unless there are no sleeping threads, in which case it does nothing.\nThe best time to use condition variables is in a producer/consumer system, like in a pipe. Producers write to a pipe, and consumers read from the pipe. The pipe buffer has a limited size, so the producer can only add data to it if the buffer is empty, and the consumer can only read from it if the buffer has contents. For simplicity, assume a buffer of single unit size for now.\nvoid *producer(void *arg) {\n    for (Int i = 0; i &lt; loops; i++) {\n        Mutex_lock(&amp;m); // lock the mutex\n        while (numfull == max) { // while the buffer is full,\n            Cond_wait(&amp;cond, &amp;m;) // wait\n        }\n        do_fill(i); // put data in buffer\n        Cond_signal(&amp;cond); // signal conditional variable\n        Mutex_unlock(&amp;m); // unlock the mutex\n    }\n}\n\nvoid *consumer(void *arg) {\n    while(1) { // consume on and on forever\n        Mutex_lock(&amp;m); // lock the mutex\n        while (numfull == 0) { // while buffer is empty,\n            Cond_wait(&amp;cond, &amp;m); // wait\n        }\n        int tmp = do_get(); // get the data\n        Cond_signal(&amp;cond); // signal conditional variable\n        Mutex_unlock(&amp;m); // unlock the mutex\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", tmp); // do something with data\n    }\n}\n\nLet's consider an example with a producer and two consumers, as well as a FIFO scheduler. The first consumer thread runs and waits immediately because the buffer is empty. The second consumer thread does the same. The producer thread runs through its entire loop, filling the buffer, then when it loops again it will wait (since our buffer is size 1). The first consumer thread will return to the while loop, and now that the buffer is no longer empty it will fetch the data, signal the thread, and finish.\nHowever, there is a problem here. The Cond_signal function signal is extremely generic and does not signal a specific thread. Instead, it will signal a random thread, which may be the producer or other consumer thread. But the whole point of using conditional variables is so that we have ordering!\nWe need to have multiple conditional variables:\nvoid *producer(void *arg) {\n    for (Int i = 0; i &lt; loops; i++) {\n        Mutex_lock(&amp;m); // lock the mutex\n        while (numfull == max) { // while the buffer is full,\n            Cond_wait(&amp;empty, &amp;m;) // wait until buffer is empty\n        }\n        do_fill(i); // put data in buffer\n        Cond_signal(&amp;fill); // signal to show buffer is somewhat filled\n        Mutex_unlock(&amp;m); // unlock the mutex\n    }\n}\n\nvoid *consumer(void *arg) {\n    while(1) { // consume on and on forever\n        Mutex_lock(&amp;m); // lock the mutex\n        while (numfull == 0) { // while buffer is empty,\n            Cond_wait(&amp;fill, &amp;m); // wait until buffer is somewhat filled\n        }\n        int tmp = do_get(); // get the data\n        Cond_signal(&amp;empty); // signal to show that buffer is empty\n        Mutex_unlock(&amp;m); // unlock the mutex\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", tmp); // do something with data\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, the consumer thread will only run when the producer has signaled that there is content in the buffer.\nSemaphore\nConditional variables do not have any state. They only signal the condition to wake or sleep a thread. This can be useful if you have lots of threads that do the exact same thing, like in a producer-consumer model. However, if you want a more complex way to represent state, you need a semaphore.\nSemaphores are essentially conditional variables that contain an integer value which can be changed by threads. This allows threads to have multiple options based on a single variable shared across multiple threads just by changing the value in the semaphore. The semaphore is incremented every time a thread is woken, and decremented every time a thread sleeps.\nThe atomic operations for semaphores are Allocate&amp;Initialize, Wait, and Post. We must first create the semaphore by allocating/initializing it. The Wait operation decrements the semaphore if it is greater than 0, and Post will increment the semaphore and wake a sleeping thread.\nIn this context, joining and exiting threads have no complication with mutexes; all you need to do is wait and post the semaphore, respectively.\nWe can actually construct locks using semaphores. Acquiring and releasing locks work the same way as waiting and posting, so you can just use those same atomic operations instead of Test&amp;Set. In reverse, you can build a semaphore using locks and conditional variables, though in practice that's a little more complicated.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/threads/","title":"Threads"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/udp/":{"body":"The simplest transport protocol that is used communicate between sockets is known as UDP, the User Datagram Protocol.\nUDP\nLet's say we want to design the simplest transport protocol possible. All this protocol needs to do is get a message from an application at the socket and send it over the network to the other socket. However, there is one more function that it needs to perform: multiplexing/demultiplexing.\nThe segment (transport layer version of a datagram) must be directed to a specific socket. There's multiple sockets that applications communicate with and they all need to be multiplexed together to create a segment, which must then be demultiplexed for the end host to understand what socket it is sent to.\nYou can think of receiving multiple envelopes in your mailbox, then demultiplexing by reading who each envelope is addressed to and giving it to the member of your household to whom it is addressed. Then, when your household members want to send all of their mail out, you multiplex it into the mailbox.\nUDP attaches a header with source and destination port numbers as fields for multiplexing, a length field, and a checksum to protect against packet corruption. Each of these fields is two bytes in length, resulting in a tiny 8-byte header.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/udp/","title":"UDP Explained"},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/waves/":{"body":"Light is curious because it is both a particle and a wave, which makes it behave strangely in certain contexts. When projected through a slit, some strange fringes will appear, which is the subject of the famous double slit experiment/\nInterference\nWhen waves combine together, it is called interference. This interference can be either constructive or destructive. When light is projected through a slit, depending on the angle from the slit to the wall behind it, the light waves will either constructively interfere or destructively interfere, creating bright and dark fringes, respectively.\nThe position of the bright fringes is given by the following equation:\n$$\nd\\sin{θ} = mλ ⇒ m = 0, 1, 2, 3...\n$$\nwhere \\(d\\) is the distance between the slits, \\(θ\\) is the angle of interference from the central max onward, and \\(m\\) is the order of the interference fringe. For bright fringes, the order of the interference fringes begins at 0 for the central bright fringe, then increments onward for each surrounding fringe. Note that there is no functional difference between a fringe on either side of the central fringe as long as they are the same order away from it.\nDark fringes have a similar equation:\n$$\nd\\sin{θ} = (m + \\frac{1}{2})λ\n$$\nThe ½ is important here because the location alternates with the bright fringes. \\(m\\) is also different because it starts at the first dark fringe surrounding the bright fringe. You can think like this:\n... 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 3 ...\nwhere the italicized numbers are dark fringes and the bold are bright fringes.\nThin Film\nInterference has a curious corollary with refraction if done through a thin film. Light that is transmitted between two media is partially reflected and partially passes through if passing from a medium of lower to higher index of refraction e.g. air to water. It is fully reflected if from higher to lower. The partially reflected light (but not the fully reflected light) undergoes a phase shift by a half wavelength.\nLet's say we want to find the distance that the light travels in the medium, the \"height\" of the medium layer \\(t\\). If the light underwent a phase shift, the equation for interference is actually flipped:\n$$\n2t = (m + \\frac{1}{2})λ_{film}\n$$\nfor constructive interference, and vice versa for destructive interference. However, if there is no net phase shift, then use the normal equations.\nNote that \\(λ_{film}\\) here is actually\n$$\nλ_{film} = \\frac{λ_{vacuum}}{n_{film}}\n$$\n\nDiffraction\nWhen a wave passes through a tiny slit, it spreads out. The slit has to be really small, as in on the order of the wavelength of the light, in order for this to happen, with more bending with a smaller slit.\nDiffraction has interference as well, so the equation for the position of dark fringes is similar, although different:\n$$\nW\\sin{θ} = mλ ⇒ m = 1,2,3...\n$$\nwhere \\(W\\) is the width of the slit. Importantly, \\(θ\\) is different here!!! It is the angle between the center of the slit and the center of the dark fringe in question. \\(m\\) is also different in that it cannot be 0! The first dark fringe in diffraction has order 1, because at order 0 there is constructive interference.\nDiffraction grating has different properties than single slit diffraction, however, and is more similar to typical interference, following the constructive interference equation for bright fringes. Be careful about \\(d\\) in this context! It refers to the distance between each slit, which you might have to derive yourself from other values.\n","id":"https://sharifhsn.github.io/waves/","title":"Waves"}},"docInfo":{"https://sharifhsn.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/circuits/":{"body":837,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/cpu-virtualization/":{"body":709,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/curry/":{"body":226,"title":3},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/data-types/":{"body":291,"title":3},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/disks/":{"body":452,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/dns/":{"body":471,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/electric-potential/":{"body":489,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/electromagnetic-waves/":{"body":471,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/electrostatics/":{"body":977,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/floating-point-architecture/":{"body":463,"title":3},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/floating-point/":{"body":792,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/ftp/":{"body":194,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/functions/":{"body":261,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/higher-order-functions/":{"body":477,"title":4},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/http/":{"body":698,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/ieee-754/":{"body":755,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/induction/":{"body":392,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/isp-addressing/":{"body":448,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/lambda-calculus/":{"body":334,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/lets-tuples-records/":{"body":421,"title":4},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/link-layer/":{"body":1277,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/lists/":{"body":514,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/magnets/":{"body":585,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/making-a-website/":{"body":974,"title":7},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/memory-virtualization/":{"body":858,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/mirrors/":{"body":560,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/multimedia/":{"body":727,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/network-security/":{"body":773,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/operational-semantics/":{"body":521,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/other-protocols/":{"body":518,"title":3},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/packet-switching/":{"body":213,"title":5},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/paging/":{"body":1256,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/particles/":{"body":219,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/prolog-control/":{"body":556,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/prolog/":{"body":1464,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/python-crash-course/":{"body":432,"title":3},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/routers/":{"body":475,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/routing-algorithms/":{"body":633,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/schedulers/":{"body":754,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/smtp/":{"body":552,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/special-relativity/":{"body":215,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/swapping/":{"body":366,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/tail-recursion/":{"body":267,"title":3},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/tcp/":{"body":830,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/threads/":{"body":1282,"title":1},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/udp/":{"body":107,"title":2},"https://sharifhsn.github.io/waves/":{"body":319,"title":1}},"length":48},"lang":"English"};
